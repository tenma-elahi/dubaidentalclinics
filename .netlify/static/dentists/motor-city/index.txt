3:T416,I had an absolutely wonderful experience at HMC Medical Centre. From the moment I walked in, I was welcomed with warmth, professionalism, and genuine care. The front desk staff was courteous and efficient, making the check-in process smooth and stress-free.

The medical team is exceptional — highly knowledgeable, attentive, and truly committed to patient well-being. My doctor took the time to listen carefully to my concerns, explained everything in detail, and ensured I was comfortable throughout. It’s rare to find such a perfect balance of expertise and compassion.

The clinic itself is spotless, modern, and well-organized. Everything felt safe, private, and hygienic, which gave me immense peace of mind.

Whether for a routine check-up or specialized treatment, HMC Medical Centre has set a new standard in healthcare. I’m truly grateful for the care I received and would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking top-quality medical attention.

Thank you, HMC, for treating me not just as a patient — but as a person. 💙4:T72f,I don't do this often but this clinic deserves it. Long story short: terrible teeth run in my family so I have spend lots of time with dentists.  The  specific reason I went to Acer was  a premolar which has been bothering me for over 10 years and was finally extracted. After the extraction I did not feel good with my previous dentist recommendation to do a bridge based on me being a smoker solely. I visited ACER - specifically Dr Jogi as I wanted to properly discuss implants with an expert. Obviously he begged me not to ruin the healthy neighbouring teeth with a bridge- we did specialised scan, got a quote and we discussed it all .Over the next month I went through all the studied re smokers, weak bone,  implants, healing time etc and then I had couple of hours what's app sessions with him re few of the contradicting studies. By the second what's app chat I was convinced I do not want the bridge and was open to doing an implant. We fitted the prostatic today and it is perfection - look, feel, exceeded my expectations. The process is long (3m) BUT its done properly , the pain is absolute minimum (I have bad gums which are extremely sensitive) and the result is worth it. I have a bridge on the other side of my jaw and cant wait to replace with another implant soon :) Dr Jogi and his whole team - the x-ray team, the nurses, the reception team and his fellow dentists are so kind , friendly and most importantly eager to discuss with you anything on your mind. Clinic is clean and has a happy, relaxed , calm feel to it. Pricing is great and frankly too low for their quality of work and compared to other clinics. I would  recommend them to anyone who needs a good team of dentists who  put your oral health before your bank account balance , and a place where any and all of your questions are welcome and answered. :)5:T761,I flew from Manchester to Dubai to serenity dental clinic to get a x-ray and my fillings done. I was so amazed and overwhelmed by how amazing the treatment was. The nurses and the receptionist were extremely kind and greeted me with all appointments. The dentists were amazing and all staff were very knowledgeable too, taking me through the whole process and educating me on everything that was going on. Modern technology is used in this clinic which was really innovative and interesting and during my fillings instead of normal anaesthetic I got the quick sleeper. Not only did I not feel a thing during the process of getting 5 fillings, but I also fell asleep from how relaxed I was especially with the environment and scenery in the clinic. After my treatment I was back to normal no pain or numbness after 30 minutes allowing me to get on with my day. I really appreciated that in the clinic, everyone was so informative and pictures were taken before and after to show true results. I had personal conversations with Dr Rena on teeth hygiene, informing me on my teeth and how to take care of them and what to use and what techniques to use. I got my new toothbrush from the clinic after Dr Rena educated me on dental hygiene. Dr Stephanie completing my fillings treatment and she was great, kind and extremely welcoming. She went out her way to come in and complete my fillings as my appointment was last minute and didn’t align with her schedule but she still made time for me and it shows how amazing the service at the clinic is. If anybody is looking for a dental clinic, that isn’t just stunning in its looks and uses modern technology, but also has amazing service and truely guides you through your dental journey I would definitely go to serenity. I will be visiting again for my future appointments. Only con is that you’ll never want to go to another clinic again!6:T4e3,I don’t usually write reviews but this one, I write with absolute conviction and pleasure.
Dr Marc Habib is THE GOAT of Endodontist doctors.
Trough almost of my life I had been going from one dentist to another in different parts of the world, I went trough all kind of dental treatments and procedures having more root canals that an average person.
With this particular tooth, which already had a root canal, 2 different doctors told me that it couldn’t be saved, that a re treatment was not possible having to go for an implant. I asked around (I live in Oman) and another good doctor recommended me Dr Habib.
I texted him and after looking the X-rays he was confident that my tooth could be saved so I travelled to Dubai to meet him.
Not only he is the coolest Dr ever, he is extremely professional and a true artist on his field.
He managed to save my tooth and now, after 7 months, my tooth is healing nicely so no need for an implant like the 2 other doctors recommended me.
Apart from all these, he was always available for any inquiry I could have.
As a patient with a sadly long history of dental problems, getting to know him was a truly blessing.
Thank you Dr Habib for the passion you put on your profession.
Warm regards,
Romina Rios8:["area","motor-city","d"]

Dr. Michael did an amazing job at the extraction of my wisdom tooth, so gentle and caring, I didn’t feel a thing and left the clinic with a smile in 30 minutes. Must mention the lovely nurses that contributed to my confort as well.\nPunctuality was spot on, receptionists were fast and welcoming and the clinic had all the extra X-rays etc that’s required for a proper checkup before diagnosis. Clean and super professional staff and doctors, easy to reach and park too.","time":"2025-08-29T11:26:24.302044626Z"}],"types":["dental_clinic","medical_clinic","point_of_interest","health","establishment"],"photos":["places/ChIJNZE8KnpuXz4RSlbZrDjhblU/photos/AcnlKN0SB4i7ssmskKPX_k8OQs2mGS1OEXIENNrptpd5_MWaCVSbxDvwsB4E7be22K1UkTpg1gTErF55XHjbRC7CB-xNWhSmPoZUeglU-rgoo4taHXdXMZwsf_81ATgBdpiR3P7EnvADNIsO_2crl0c0_rfp_yUGPXGzJHV_gf1M659YNQOSaDIiBgL9uxdd-Kr9fFVSR5dltLweEj5o7tCUIjLTSy0Uv92_GJGSZ2gX9pD70gIdMNJKV3gbdlj7xkLvCTOzn0Y3tFRI881x8XGuXxboIkP4LHoFk6R8cWMioSrN5g","places/ChIJNZE8KnpuXz4RSlbZrDjhblU/photos/AcnlKN3miRhes0uMc59qhwm069UamU8UFvQpgFNruSQ22eGUAZ9XqQPJzAsNGqPTO6sBuEApa_SrXCpuGy1mQCT0MQfpTe0Q2aApJ5jghb2wZCgHqSqqs545Pmgw6lRZn_yQcF1Gz8QKhxJjmTc4kGSED9qgJTjj4lcyQ8tn-GGwYzLJiKGCliNQg3YFcIALpZh-uer_WVCugAU_cGGHgyDNGP39a2miuqBcwvONzvFBEiRsFr1aNjL6edqnaNHLWovNntPrACIFYQvIGMTgc3McC_jget-n4k9WavDmBMPqctNqog","places/ChIJNZE8KnpuXz4RSlbZrDjhblU/photos/AcnlKN0vJDeb2XAV3XoP23wOPYjWyqlrEP6C4dFcBPS04VJRNnkWrsIIlHtBHLBawc7cjwYbZTQmMGDy0tSBFTiGzQkIqUZjeDH_m7bHN8bHJDhZbVZD4HjSyHIduli6ataZj33ATd8-v-frkW95DzK080t1y8zRUllD7uRna8GWDm8JgXByTeXlK9RBK5RprT3mrmu6f3mwAx8fQqAGosZFK5zYZij86uq9qlIYuElVeDGBzyVUfIX5-JVxOWDAvLxyW9TrbDLozrHLDr5ZIx2G-iH4j73VoKZljzVOXWvhwmYBhQ"]},{"name":"Revive By OrthoSports","slug":"revive-by-orthosports","address":"OFFICE 715, Detroit House - Detroit Rd - Al Hebiah First - Dubai Motor City - Dubai - United Arab Emirates","area":"Motor City","phone":"800 662726","website":"https://reviveclinic.ae/","rating":4.6,"reviewCount":67,"services":["General Dentistry","Orthodontics","Teeth Whitening","Root Canal"],"hours":"Mon-Sat: 10:00 AM – 6:00 PM","description":"Professional dental care in Motor City offering comprehensive dental services.","lat":25.0461916,"lng":55.2320308,"placeId":"ChIJR-AFN5xvXz4RbHmS0fVHwpg","googleMapsUrl":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=11007439560355510636&g_mp=Cidnb29nbGUubWFwcy5wbGFjZXMudjEuUGxhY2VzLlNlYXJjaFRleHQQAhgEIAA","reviews":[{"author":"F A","rating":5,"text":"I had an excellent experience with Dr. Farina Amin.\nShe did a thorough teeth cleaning and carefully removed an old filling.

3:T752,I recently attended an inspiring seminar “Be Slim & Beautiful” in the Vida Clinic, focusing on women’s wellness and organized to educate and introduce various health and beauty enhancement options.

Dr. Archana, provided valuable insights into wellness practices and introduced an array of courses designed to help women achieve their health and aesthetic goals. I have had taken a physiotherapy + dry needling treatment from her for frozen shoulder and acute lower back pain and having very positive+ calming results. Always best wishes for her.

Thanks to Dr. Priyanka for covering various slimming treatments specifically aimed at inch loss. Her explanations were insightful, addressing both the technical and practical aspects of these treatments, making it easy for attendees to understand how they could benefit.

Aesthetic Skin + Hair Treatments, including trending semi-permanent makeup techniques, presented by certified aesthetician Sweety Pawar. She showcased a variety of popular options in semi-permanent makeup, offering innovative solutions that enhance natural beauty in a convenient and lasting way.
Having personally experienced a few of these beauty treatments, I can confidently say the changes, though subtle, have made a remarkable difference in my appearance. Sweety’s expertise and guidance have been invaluable, Many thanks to Sweety, and much love always!

An especially impactful part of the seminar was the breast cancer awareness session led by Dr. Champa. This segment brought critical health information to the forefront, encouraging preventive care and early detection strategies, which could be life-saving.

Overall, the event was a great success in spreading awareness and providing practical guidance on wellness and beauty. It was both informative and empowering, and I look forward to attending more such sessions in the future.4:T567,5 Stars – Highly Recommended! I would like to highly commend Nurse Hina for her outstanding care and professionalism. From my first visit with Dr. Champa, who is an exceptional and experienced OB-Gyne, Nurse Hina immediately stood out. She is not only skilled and knowledgeable in her work, but also incredibly polite, sweet, and always wears a warm smile that instantly makes patients feel at ease.

During my first blood draw, Nurse Hina was so gentle and precise, I didn’t feel any pain at all. On subsequent visits when other nurses performed the blood draw, I noticed the difference. Nurse Hina’s technique is truly superior, and it’s clear she takes great pride in doing her job with care and accuracy. She is active, attentive, and shows genuine concern for the well-being of her patients.

I also want to acknowledge Amir at the front reception. He is very polite and welcoming, making the check-in process smooth and stress-free. His kind and gentle demeanor contributes to a great overall experience at the clinic.

I’m very thankful to be under the care of such a dedicated and professional team. Special thanks again to Dr. Champa, Nurse Hina, and Amir you all make a difference!

Thank you to the entire VIDA Clinic team for making each visit a positive one. Special thanks to Hina, Amir, and Dr. Champa for going above and beyond. You truly make a difference!6:["area","bur-dubai","d"]

The main entrance comprises approximately five steps without any accompanying handrails or supportive structures, posing a potential risk for elderly visitors, patients with mobility limitations, or those recovering from medical procedures.\n\nFrom an accessibility and patient-safety standpoint, healthcare facilities should ensure that supportive features such as railings, ramps, and slip-resistant surfaces are present throughout the premises — particularly at entrances, corridors, and washrooms. Implementing such measures not only enhances compliance with accessibility standards but also reflects a genuine commitment to patient comfort and safety.","time":"2025-10-25T13:06:07.349058573Z"}],"types":["medical_center","dental_clinic","skin_care_clinic","hospital","medical_clinic","doctor","health","service","point_of_interest","establishment"],"photos":["places/ChIJ4yWPpwJDXz4RhL4Heviy-eM/photos/AcnlKN1-xWy46tTD1cdtikv-2C2WUqLJicLzWRc5mLzzFGdvbhhJ8x0ojGLkEzyJz6r8Lru2not7ktUNekV74-4-m_HyJYvtiPimkBpTKITeDxNXJ0hhAXnBCvEgrFjPmY6FTnUV6vMQbho9DWkx_4Rgg8zRSvJt-riQTfDvj8arLRnuSikjZTrHOSMtbkxWEW6vzS-VvlneDnIH5zBnidAMnOB3S-w79ws9Oh6qAD8ffAfDGkyjBTiXgSbP1LGafcD0w-fw2g4glfuoBVd0yrhKOvrwMWHM8CiWugZJrzT1SIA","places/ChIJ4yWPpwJDXz4RhL4Heviy-eM/photos/AcnlKN2g_dnNRCWP3_o2u3JKdBuuPC6gBX_BONoSrw-TvVpwat87-55X9Si4jznJz7NN_FO_6_aHtbB2RIssYk58bJrksqLwwqhA9_o3-xmqzvLU5FeKDS7KDUD0LCp5-kq9UtHBH1uc2FjDHBXHhnjMcZuW3jAOxloAhu1LhEZts2kq4uJfGZJ6LbDV2NL3cMblWFmrl23zZkbwoqYYmxBsXy9qr7x-W4LNvmCV7m-frqzC-v87uz01D5H_ETO5Zg85_XDPF0f_2D6lICRkXFSZBNZVn4TiCFN0uEZxNxzrUrgzRZ0Rqn4GOAhGtl-m8b7ZfiFDhDgAo8T-YftqEHaUwjJKM-nFk_AbY6QXsYI7kfboW2vz4z8iPDjtSx65aBtL1plcMfeCJjxqaPOCiEGSuflXUWZ3_X_CYagBBXioe3dWQ9p6","places/ChIJ4yWPpwJDXz4RhL4Heviy-eM/photos/AcnlKN3xnihA_mIM3pg60NVWXZ6XBlisAiruOjQaoAnOJOK2ui3Z4yTpIOKCRZHbKYvIhG_1-hVvK4VKnQgEHzLMZ-kDecryCiyl2VCqXaUlN_FzxpOjqn6dmIhlbzot0PF5iys4Djjq06jmR3gPiKE5Kfb1N1iTIRgG7YRC2hOORPeSVhFtz8ke90lxTkDEnRbwkTkQLN6qlM6EcHn_bBjXf09X4_jNbvlXHFTWyYUZwrLuIUZffXzc4kYyydH62lq-58SCfDynEBFRqRw4R-l1lzbtghD7JjPzI9lZ5HKOB6KXBla4Z2UHYo_oq42yFivx8F_8msMn4qIvwaqTlaXxTrbcwh6q2XichMv8f4NccpWPZHYNqVjt-TpMStGSGm7EWdVMA6q3Uhp9w50n4FajlQtyF643Uo5NgEP9Kd046Uq3cg"]},{"name":"KIMS HEALTH MEDICAL CENTER, BURDUBAI(AL RASHIDIYAH PVT POLY CLINIC)","slug":"kims-health-medical-center-burdubaial-rashidiyah-pvt-poly-clinic","address":"Levels: G, 1 & 2, RTA Car Parking Building - Opp. Ambassador Hotel، Bur Dubai - Al Souq Al Kabeer - Al Fahidi - Dubai - United Arab Emirates","area":"Bur Dubai","phone":"04 393 9383","website":"https://www.kimshealth.ae/?utm_source=organic&utm_medium=gbp&utm_campaign=gbp-link","rating":4.3,"reviewCount":1083,"services":["General Dentistry","Teeth Whitening","Root Canal"],"hours":"Mon-Sat: 8:00 AM – 10:30 PM","description":"Professional dental care in Bur Dubai offering comprehensive dental services.","lat":25.263697999999998,"lng":55.290879,"placeId":"ChIJkdl512pDXz4RNk5JKkH-dbU","googleMapsUrl":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=13075636648975879734&g_mp=Cidnb29nbGUubWFwcy5wbGFjZXMudjEuUGxhY2VzLlNlYXJjaFRleHQQAhgEIAA","reviews":[{"author":"sunil khadka","rating":5,"text":"I had an excellent experience with Dr. Talha Ahmed Qureshi from the first consultation found him extremely professional, patient, and knowledgeable.\nThe diagnosis was accurate, the treatment was effective, and the follow-up was thorough.

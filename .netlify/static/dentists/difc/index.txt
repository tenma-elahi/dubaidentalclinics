3:T48e,I cannot recommend Dr. Fareeda and Nurse Shem highly enough. From the moment I arrived, I felt genuinely welcome and completely at ease, as if I were being cared for in my own home. Dr. Fareeda is, without a doubt, a superb professional. Her expertise and knowledge are evident in every interaction. She took the time to explain the procedure thoroughly, ensuring all my questions were answered with clarity and patience. Her technique is flawless, making the treatment feel seamless and comfortable. When you are under her care, you know you are receiving the absolute best, most professional treatment available. Equally outstanding is Nurse Shem. She is the definition of compassionate care, consistently warm, reassuring, and attentive. She has a remarkable ability to make the entire experience feel relaxed and comforting. Her friendly demeanor and genuine concern for my well-being truly contribute to the wonderful, "at home" atmosphere of the clinic.If you are looking for exceptional professionalism combined with a warm, personal touch, this is the team you need to see.
Thank you, Dr. Fareeda and Nurse Shem, for making every visit a positive experience.4:T521,I visited My London Skin Clinic after feeling constantly exhausted and struggling to focus, despite living what I believed to be a healthy lifestyle. From the very beginning, the experience was exceptional.

I completed a full blood test with Dr Sobia, which clearly identified my deficiencies. She took the time to explain the results in detail, walking me through the charts and ensuring I fully understood what was going on in my body and how we could address it. Her approach was both professional and reassuring, and I never felt rushed.

What really impressed me was how quickly and conveniently we were able to start treatment immediately. Dr Sobia made me feel completely relaxed, informed, and confident in the process.

Her assistant Eve was also incredibly kind and reassuring throughout my visit, which made the experience even more comfortable. A special mention must also go to Gerald, the clinic’s barista, who is genuinely friendly and caring and adds a lovely personal touch to the clinic experience.

The aftercare has been outstanding — Dr Sobia personally checked in with me the following day after my treatments, which really shows how much she cares about her patients.

I highly recommend My London Skin Clinic for anyone looking for thorough, professional, and truly personalised care.5:T5ff,I have never been a fan of dentists and always went to the ones trusted as I had a traumatic experience as a child.
When I went to Roz Clinic to remove my very old and very inflamed root canals I was met by a smiling Dr. Omar who took me to his dental room where he thoroughly checked my X-rays and scans and explained clearly and fully all he saw and what the procedure he would preform would be. The sense of trust was almost immediate as I knew his capabilities not only from his degrees and experience but also his detailed diagnosis and exact plans.
I was very right to put my trust in Dr. Omar as throughout the very intense and long procedure he still kept me aware of all he will be doing and all that will be happening and that was instrumental in my ability to stay calm throughout the 5 hours it took to finish all the dental work and also the initial new implants.
The 6 month it takes from infected root canals and old extractions to new ceramic implants and crowns is almost over and the inflammation in my mouth and the swollen glands around my jaws are almost gone.
It was not an easy trip but I am so happy I went through this ordeal with Dr. Omar and no one else because he did a great job with care and kindness.
If I can summarise my experience with Dr. Omar it would be that I never went into the dark cave that would amplify my fear and thus pain but there was a light shed by him throughout that at least made the fear obsolete so the pain would be minimised.
Thank you Dr. Omar El Mahir and thank you Roz Clinic6:T613,In my childhood I had experienced a tooth trauma. As a result big abscess was formed, which unfortunately became chronic after many years of overlooking.
With Dr. Omar I went through few months process of tooth extraction, implant placing, healing, gum grafting…ect. In such a long period of time you as a patient can notice every single detail about the work of your dentist.
I must say it was more than perfect from the beginning to the end.
Dr Omar explains all the procedures clearly in required details (which was very detailed in my case 😅). At the same time he listens emphatically and also pays attention to all the concerns and fears.
He was really building my trust from the beginning and despite going through 2 difficult surgeries I was always coming to Dr. Roze with big smile (with temporary implant which was always placed there was not even disturbing 🤣)
His sense of humor and also understanding mine helped us both to go through this not very easy process in the most smooth way possible.
I am sure that his gentle approach during surgical procedures helped my body to heal much quicker after the surgeries. What makes Dr. Omar particularly remarkable is his ability to combine technical perfection with a gentle compassionate approach. Even during complex oral surgery he maintained a calm and reassuring presence, ensuring I feel comfortable and confident throughout the process.
I really highly recommend Dr Omar El Mahir.
He is exceptionally skilled biological dentist specialized in ceramic implants and aesthetic dentistry.7:T466,From the moment I walked into Rocco’s new specialized dental clinic, I was impressed. The clinic itself is absolutely stunning modern, spotless, and designed with both comfort and professionalism in mind. Cleanliness is clearly a top priority, and it shows in every detail.

What truly sets this clinic apart, though, is the experience with Dr. Rocco himself. His professionalism is unmatched, and his warm, approachable personality immediately puts you at ease. He takes the time to explain every step with care, making sure you feel comfortable and confident throughout the process.

Beyond his expertise, Dr. Rocco has a genuine gift — he makes you feel welcome, cared for, and valued as a patient. It’s rare to find a dentist who combines technical excellence with such kindness and charm. I walked out not only with the best smile I’ve ever had, but with full confidence that I’ve found the best dentist.

Without a doubt, Rocco’s clinic is a winning combination of world-class dental care and heartfelt service. Highly recommended for anyone who values both exceptional results and an outstanding experience.8:T432,I cannot shout enough about Dr. Rocco! After struggling with dental issues for years and seeing many dentists who unfortunately left me with both health and cosmetic problems, I finally found the one who changed everything.
Dr. Rocco not only took the time to repair years of damage from previous treatments, but he also focused on restoring my overall dental health while improving the aesthetics of my smile. What makes him truly exceptional is his ability to combine medical expertise with an artistic eye — it’s truly art meeting dentistry.
For the first time in years, I walked into a dental clinic and felt I could completely trust and surrender to my doctor. That level of confidence is priceless. Dr. Rocco is not just a dentist; he is a gifted professional with a rare talent, passion, and dedication.
I am beyond grateful for the care, precision, and artistry he has put into my treatments. If you ever get the opportunity to be in his hands, consider yourself lucky. He is by far the most exceptional dentist I have ever met — a true gift to his profession!9:T500,I recently had the pleasure of being treated by Dr. Mohamad Mustafa, and I can’t recommend him highly enough. His expertise in dentistry is truly impressive. I went to him for a root canal, and he handled the re-treatment and apicoectomy with remarkable skill, alleviating my discomfort and ensuring a smooth recovery.

Dr. Mustafa's work on my crown was equally impressive. The zirconium crown he placed not only feels natural but also looks perfect. I also had veneers done, and the max veneers have transformed my smile beautifully.

He’s also adept with pediatric dentistry—my child’s visit was handled with such care and patience. Additionally, his work on my composite fillings and extraction procedures was flawless.

His clinic is well-equipped for a wide range of treatments, from full dentures to full mouth rehabilitation. I was particularly impressed with his approach to gummy smile rehabilitation and gum treatments; his methods are both effective and gentle.

Overall, Dr. Mustafa’s comprehensive knowledge, attention to detail, and compassionate care make him a standout in the field of dentistry. If you’re looking for a top-notch dentist who can handle everything from simple orthodontics to complex procedures, Dr. Mohamad Mustafa is the one to see.b:["area","difc","d"]

3:T596,This isn't the first time I've had a bad experience with this clinic. First, I had an appointment with their dental department, but during the treatment, the dentist hit my gums three times, causing pain and bleeding. She wasn't careful at all, so I stopped the treatment and canceled the appointment.

My second experience was with their aesthetic clinic for a hydra facial and PRP treatment. The nurse, Sheejah, was excellent, but the staff, especially the receptionist, didn't do her job properly. I booked an appointment over the phone and informed her that I had a package deal for hydra facial and PRP. However, when I arrived at the clinic, I waited for two hours, and when I finally saw a doctor, it wasn't Nurse Sheejah. The doctor refused to perform both treatments, saying she was only scheduled to do the PRP, and it wasn't her job to do the hydra facial.

I went back to the receptionist, and she claimed that I had only booked the PRP treatment, which wasn't true. I argued with her, and the manager intervened, explaining that I should have informed them about my package deal over the phone. I pointed out that the receptionist had already asked for my full name and number, and I had mentioned that I had a package deal, so it was already registered in their system.
Now, I have to wait another hour for my treatment, which is frustrating. I feel that the clinic's communication and organization need improvement.4:T4f6,Let me start off with the first thing they advertise.
1. Free aesthetic consultation worth AED 200.
The moment i entered the doctor’s room, all she asked was which procedure i want to get and got the paper signed to start the procedure. Not a single look onto my skin, no advises or suggestions, no walking through the procedures, no checking skin type or anything. Is this what you call consultation?

2. I got hydra facial done in 15 -18 mins that was supposed to last 30 minutes.

3. No skin prep or cleansing was done. The neck area was not touched properly.

4. I had the worst extraction of blackheads and whiteheads ever. I know how it feels when the pores are cleaned properly since i get it done frequently. But this was the worst. She just touched my face for name sake. I came home to see all the black and white heads the same as it was.

5. Yes, my skin did feel hydrated because of the last step of the procedure when she applied something on my face and asked me to let it stay. The next day morning, my skin looked darker than before, and scars are more visible.

We went in for 2 people but only 1 person got it done. thank God we didnt waste anymore money.

If any procedure is done, even if it is the cheapest, please try to improve quality of work.5:T64b,My experience with Meta Clinic was good initially when I went for wart removal that’s Why I wish to go ahead and have my session they made me pay for the unlimited session,  They were advertising about unlimited session then After the payments only they let me know that it’s limited to succession for the full body laser and they made me sign of document that I want staff will be appointed for my sessions. But they change the stuff in between, but I found that  Ms. Anna was much better than The previous staff allocated for me she was very patient and as you know, the latest session are not easy. It’s still a parent session she had. She showed me the patience of doing the session slowly without making any pain, but when I ask the same person for my next session, the coordinator was very rude and giving explanation that we have signed the contract that the staff will not be available and she was very rude and not flexible at all I want to take the session in different Branch to have my have Anna for my rest of the session. The coordinator was giving silly excuses and And threatened me about the contract, which I signed Sign the contract before signing it’s just I just asked them to give an Anna because I was comfortable doing my session with her again the coordinator told me to go and find Call and find out who is available on my day so that I can be prepared on the day for it. I don’t understand why this lady told me to be mentally prepared if she doesn’t want me to give me the person I wish to have for my sis, just by knowing a persons name will not help me in the session .6:T5d9,I’ve been a client of this clinic for years and have never experienced anything like what happened over the past two months. My partner and I both had Botox done (three areas each) and paid full price. Within four weeks, the results had completely worn off. When we returned, the clinic acknowledged that they had received a bad batch and told us that several other clients experienced the same issue. They assured us they would re-treat us for free, as it was their responsibility.

Fast forward 4–5 weeks after the complimentary correction, and once again the results had completely worn off. We returned today expecting the clinic to honour what they had previously admitted, that the treatment clearly hadn’t worked, twice.

Instead, after speaking with the owner, the doctor and clinic manager informed us that they would only offer a “two-for-one” deal. In other words, I was being asked to pay again effectively for three full treatments despite the fact that the first two rounds produced no lasting results whatsoever. Both staff members openly acknowledged that Botox should last 4–6 months, and that ours clearly hadn’t, yet the owner refused to stand over it.

I find it shocking that any reputable clinic would treat clients this way, especially after admitting the product failed not once but twice. Based on this experience, I absolutely cannot recommend this clinic. The lack of accountability and the disregard for customers is extremely disappointing.

Adam Fleming7:T4b3,This review is actually long overdue! I had an excellent experience with Dr. Manoj Kumar a few months back, and I can confidently say he is one of the most patient and professional dentists I have ever visited.
I came in with a broken dental bridge, which had been causing me a lot of discomfort and anxiety, but from the very beginning Dr. Manoj made me feel calm and reassured.
He took the time to clearly explain the entire process before starting, including how the broken bridge would be removed and how the new bridge would be fitted. Throughout the procedure, he was extremely gentle and attentive.
From start to finish, he was thorough and detail-oriented. He did not rush any part of the process and made sure the new bridge was properly fitted, comfortable, and with a proper bite.
Even after the procedure, the clinic checked that everything felt right and that I was satisfied with the results.
Overall, I felt genuinely cared for as a patient and would highly recommend Dr. Manoj to anyone looking for a dentist who is skilled, compassionate, and takes the time to ensure your comfort every step of the way.
I am very happy with my new bridge and grateful for the excellent care I received.8:T4eb,A very bad experience.
I am Very sad to say: I paid 3,860 AED for a full implant at IMedClinic Dubai (Pineapple Building, Al Barsha), but due to a medical condition, I could no longer complete the procedure and requested a refund. I have been trying to get this refund for one and a half months with almost no response from the clinic.

When they finally replied, they said the doctor was on holiday. Since then, three weeks have passed with no refund. I had to go personally to the clinic to speak to Dr. Ahmed Eldesouki, who seems to be the owner of the place! He promised a refund within 24–48 hours, but even after six days, nothing has been processed.

The clinic also tried to mislead me about the amount I paid, not correcting my messages saying i paid 2,910 AED instead of the actual 3,860 AED. And, they asked me to transfer my payments into the doctor’s personal account instead of through the clinic, which felt very unusual and …unprofessional. They did not provide a proper invoice as well, but only a screen shoot of the amount received. Their handling of this situation has been completely unacceptable.

Due to their inaction, I have now escalated the case to the Dubai Economic Department (DED) Consumer Protection).

How ugly is this!?9:T5ea,I had a very disappointing experience at this clinic. I was initially quoted 500 AED per front tooth, for 4front teeth crowns but once the treatment began, an additional 500 AED was demanded, and I did. After the procedure, the color of the teeth did not match my natural teeth. Even after they were replaced, the problem remained. The teeth have since become more yellow, poorly shaped, and have caused inflammation and bad breath.

This has caused me significant discomfort and stress. Based on my experience, I cannot recommend this clinic.

2 ⭐️ for being nice and welcoming but the job wasn’t that good so i am forced to get back to my home country to check with my dentist.

✨LET’S CLARIFY YOUR ANSWER TO MY REVIEW✨
First my mistake yeah it was crown not veneers.
Second regarding the price. I was first told the treatment cost was AED 3,500. Later, I was charged AED 3,000 the receipt down here. However, in the reply to my review, it was stated that the original price was AED 5,000 reduced to AED 2,400. This wasn’t the case in my experience so if you’re not sure about something do not spit it I was never quoted AED 5,000 and no one will give you a discount of 54%.
After I posted my review, I also received several phone calls (by someone of the staff not Dr. Mohammed)asking me to delete it, which made me feel pressured. I believe reviews should reflect honest personal experiences, so I prefer to keep mine as it is.

This review is based only on my personal experience as a patient.a:T69c,No words or stars could ever truly express our gratitude for Dr. Garima. She is an amazing dentist and a true blessing for children, especially those with special needs, like our son who has autistic traits.

As parents, we faced numerous challenges in addressing his dental issues. He is extremely sensitive, doesn’t tolerate even the slightest touch in his mouth, and moves a lot, making any dental procedure incredibly difficult.

For many years, he struggled with severe dental problems. Several of his teeth were damaged, two were stuck under the gum, unable to erupt, and he had multiple cavities that needed filling. Despite trying multiple approaches, the only viable solution left was to perform the procedure under general anesthesia.

Naturally, we were extremely concerned and afraid about putting him under GA in an operating theater. However, Dr. Garima explained the entire process in detail, addressed all our concerns, and gave us the confidence we needed to proceed.

She handled everything so professionally, and the entire experience was smooth and stress-free for us. Thanks to her meticulous planning and expertise, my son didn’t feel any discomfort throughout the process.

During the procedure, Dr. Garima removed multiple damaged teeth, performed a root canal, filled cavities, laser procedure for the impacted teeths, and thoroughly cleaned his all teeth—all without any issues. She truly is an amazing person who resolved years of my son’s dental problems on the very first day of the new year.

Thank you, Dr. Garima, for your time, effort, and dedication to helping my son. May God bless you and grant you more opportunities to help other parents like us.c:["area","al-barsha","d"]

Unfortunately, the recommended Doctor by my colleague was on leave so I opted for hydrafacial. While browsing the services they offer, I saw 4D face treatment. To my curiosity I asked about it and was convinced to try the treatment since my problem was dullness of skin, early signs of aging and uneven skin tone. Thanaa, was so patient to answer all my questions and did convince me to try it. I’m really happy after my first session. Looking forward for the coming months for my next sessions and to see the end result! I highly recommend Thanaa for your treatment as she will give you the best experience!

I booked my appointment through WhatsApp and was informed that the scaling would cost 70 AED, rest covered by my insurance.

This was only explained after the procedure, when I pointed out that the stains were still visible. The doctor later acknowledged that this was his mistake. To make matters worse, the final bill unexpectedly increased to over XYZ AED due to a “consultation fee,” which was never communicated at the time of booking or before starting the treatment. This lack of transparency is unacceptable. I strongly advise future patients to clearly confirm both the services and the final cost in advance.

Do visit her to get an honest opinion.","time":"2025-11-06T05:38:05.787537931Z"}],"types":["dentist","doctor","health","point_of_interest","establishment"],"photos":["places/ChIJBayLD-1DXz4RGehJczjXRrk/photos/AcnlKN1zvQ136YezlEd41AA6qCnJNWEPs9xy5CUQyD4loljJ9Zl6sePtwEPeHaeTxJzQklU-A1nCaECmZEwGrivXQYw1xJCaXdWmOlaswYj8lRIrSJcuuq6NDgsgCOwYAthNEzhoWONAJpJ6a8v2yKQUGMgNTXA0QisCOeJdd_tumYuDuFWzWjI5cfa_eG6QdQzS9YbxLdhT0wE2bGbZP7z8Oqixn6AviaTU2WZcCXWH0jqJz79XDYB2QX82esIdmTFbop3BuaBCZgT1uLA7uU3jMbXgJAFZNL7XBz2EVkgiIys","places/ChIJBayLD-1DXz4RGehJczjXRrk/photos/AcnlKN1rGa0CVggd4osupI0UC4t_GBs2NXgHTERDMPBhlR-i3O35pfMxweJuoZBmoZw9ABw1oLwvVpBlyoMPo8Xar75qWwU6H-qw_8psFZTPNEuR5o5I1mp2no_Afi3uPU7bUP6QrgYSxyfMiU2UKAuS5WIQjNn97D-V5fuiH-HZZ872GwFQAFJwC6DIKinatJfeuj8fTCEjIOJ70NbkbOrp-VW0a99juH2rAH6_AaY6aAgH3wx093tbcFaf6b6OQd15Kh5a1Fnp6lv8stD_Ae6OnfpT7E8lSr5s0t-1gGnLHoU","places/ChIJBayLD-1DXz4RGehJczjXRrk/photos/AcnlKN0ivxG9pbAZnM35de-Yq7B-3k0uzO9B8UEXxYMaN0-P8p9o-FmvC0OlzBMtc0hIEPvBNyPq0NDNXVTC4eBmj0wGbhsTmhWajO6JUMpA0l7kpi_bGMbdQCj9IFGTfssyHJUk4T2J0j5GpxazM8Z6heEWaTXnLiw1I-QjfsbF_KgDCOTVl0U1bdXTFXC4xyznzjQWSag6wafjPH_dHn3L90SOzE5Aw2srJPHKNqWu9RPKU4d5dNy8h1NfopnLOLz05eKtGG3Qk6at8_wD2GaXS4IfDZcxOpaPAd7R8MmJabE"]},{"name":"Healthpoint For General Dental Clinic","slug":"healthpoint-for-general-dental-clinic","address":"Al, Bedaia Building - Office 603 Street 3 - Al Barsha First - Al Barsha - Dubai - United Arab Emirates","area":"Al Barsha","phone":"058 588 6915","website":"","rating":4.7,"reviewCount":331,"services":["General Dentistry","Teeth Whitening","Root Canal"],"hours":"Mon-Sat: 9:00 AM – 9:00 PM","description":"Professional dental care in Al Barsha offering comprehensive dental services.","lat":25.113632,"lng":55.204475,"placeId":"ChIJ4_GqUYNrXz4RfWMdaBuZXoc","googleMapsUrl":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=9754402185920996221&g_mp=Cidnb29nbGUubWFwcy5wbGFjZXMudjEuUGxhY2VzLlNlYXJjaFRleHQQAhgEIAA","reviews":[{"author":"nadim bakshi","rating":1,"text":"Hello,  The initial package was 300 dirhams, and I was advertised to pay extra 100 dirhams for work to be done properly.

I went in because a very small piece of a filling that had been in place for years had broken. Instead of repairing it, a task that takes less than a minute as I already had it for another tooth in the past, I was advised that the entire filling needed to be replaced.\n\nDuring the procedure, the work went too deep and reached the nerves, and I was told afterward that if I experienced pain, I would need a root canal. Unfortunately, I did have significant pain in the days that followed.\n\nI decided to seek a second opinion, and another dentist confirmed through X-Ray that the hole is too deep and the nerves needed to be removed. This resulted in additional treatment that I had hoped to avoid.\n\nI wish there had been a more conservative approach.

Seeing the end goal made it easy to say \"yes.\"\n• Expertise: Dr. Titus and Dr. Smily are professors at dental colleges, which gave me huge confidence in their clinical skills.\n• Efficiency: Unlike my friends who dealt with broken aligners or \"starting over,\" my process has been seamless and high-quality.\n• Affordability: Their prices are very competitive because they have their own lab in Dubai somewhere.\nThe staff is incredibly hospitable, and I’m so excited to see the final result.

After it was treated, I was advised to also treat the adjacent tooth purely for aesthetic reasons, as it did not match the color of the repaired tooth. I agreed based on this recommendation and paid AED 800.\n\nSince then, the bonding on both teeth has broken multiple times, requiring several return visits. After losing a significant amount of time, I was later informed that the treatment I paid for was not a permanent solution and that I would now need a different and more expensive procedure (veneer or crown). This was not clearly explained before I was charged.\n\nI arrived with one minor issue and left with two teeth affected, additional costs, and the need to seek treatment at another clinic to properly resolve the problem.\n\nCommunication and follow-up were also frustrating.

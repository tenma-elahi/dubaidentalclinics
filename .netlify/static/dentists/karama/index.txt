3:T437,Had an extremely disappointing experience at Dr. Joseph's Polyclinic, Karama today at around 7:00pm. Chaotic from the start: took a token, but staff randomly requested people to come for registration while screens updated haphazardly. They mixed up phone numbers despite me giving mine twice and curtly told us to wait at Room 9—instead of explaining why not go directly to the doctor at Room 15. Token system made no sense: clear favoritism for patients speaking the staff's language at Room 9 entrance. Huge crowd jammed there, no token order followed—screens only flash after Room 9 checks, but nurses ignored tokens entirely.

After nearly an hour, my token never showed; they called my mother's old number from years ago. Zero empathy or coordination. Refund handled bluntly, no apology—like they couldn't care less.

Shocked at the 4.8 rating across 6,910 reviews. Obvious favoritism and zero empathy from the nurses—who should be ashamed of their behavior. Will urge friends, colleagues, and relatives to avoid. Patients deserve compassion, not a marketplace rush.4:T45c,I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Dr. Josephs Polyclinic Karama for the exceptional care my wife received today.

My wife suddenly developed a severe allergic reaction after lunch— intense itching and stomach pain — and by the time we reached the clinic, she could barely walk. Despite the clinic being very crowded, the reception team immediately understood the urgency and arranged for a doctor without any delay.

Dr. Bindu Shaji personally came out to check on my wife the moment she saw her condition. The staff quickly brought a wheelchair and moved her to the emergency room, treating her with the same care and concern as a family member. Their calmness, professionalism, and empathy truly made a frightening situation much easier to handle.

I am deeply thankful to Dr. Bindu Shaji for her swift response and kindness. A special thanks as well to Manager Deepika for her constant support and reassurance throughout, and to all the nurses who took such gentle and attentive care of my wife.

We are truly grateful for the entire team. Thank you for being there when we needed help the most.5:T755,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 5/5

I had an exceptional experience with Dr. Karthik, and I genuinely feel fortunate to have found him. I came to him with a complicated orthodontic issue — my molar had been tilted inward since I was 12, and it had never erupted properly. I had sleepless nights with the sensitivity problems . I couldn't even drink water at normal temperatures or breathe cold air . Almost every dentist I visited in the UAE told me the same thing: “You need surgery, implants ” or “We have to remove your wisdom tooth" and some even mentioned my braces journey will take 5 years .

But Dr. Karthik stood out immediately. His calm confidence, deep expertise, and clear explanation gave me hope. I met Dr.Karthik through my friends referral and I was hopeless when I was going but I came back with so much happiness . Dr.Karthik was the only one doctor who told we can do this procedure without a single surgery . Instead of rushing to surgery, he used his advanced understanding of dental physics and biomechanics to gently guide the tooth into place. What many said was “impossible” or “too complex,” he handled with precision and patience.

Throughout my braces journey, he monitored every detail carefully. His ability to solve complications, his commitment to getting the perfect result, and the genuine care he shows for his patients truly set him apart. He treated my case not as a challenge, but as a responsibility — and that level of dedication is rare to find.

I am incredibly grateful for his skill, professionalism, and the comfort he provided at every visit. If you want a dentist who combines talent, experience, and heart, Dr. Karthik is the one you can trust without a second thought. One of the most remarkable doctors I’ve ever met!
Now finally I removed my braces in 1yr9months.thanks to Dr.KARTHIK (Dr.SIRAJUDEEN MEDICAL CENTRE-DUBAI)6:T57f,I had an amazing experience with Dr. Karthik during my Invisalign treatment, and I honestly couldn’t be happier with the results or the journey. From the very first consultation, he made everything feel comfortable, easy to understand, and stress-free. Invisalign can feel intimidating at first, but Dr. Karthik took the time to explain every step of the process clearly and patiently, which really put me at ease.

What truly sets Dr. Karthik apart is his perfect balance of professionalism and personality. He is extremely knowledgeable and clearly an expert in what he does, but at the same time he’s fun, friendly, and genuinely enjoyable to be around. Every appointment felt relaxed and positive, and he somehow managed to make the entire treatment process feel fun instead of overwhelming.

He was always attentive to my concerns, answered all my questions thoroughly, and made sure I was comfortable at every stage of the treatment. I always felt confident that I was in great hands. Thanks to his skill and attention to detail, my Invisalign journey was smooth, effective, and actually enjoyable.

If you’re considering Invisalign or any dental treatment, I highly recommend Dr. Karthik. He truly cares about his patients, delivers excellent results, and makes the whole experience easy and pleasant. I’m incredibly grateful for his work and couldn’t ask for a better dentist! 😁🙌🙌7:T4e0,I highly recommend Dr. Katherine Ola and Nurse Ellen. After experiencing two miscarriages, finding the right OB was very important to me, and I’m deeply grateful that I found them. Dr. Ola is incredibly approachable and always reassured me that my baby and I would be okay. She was the only OB who recommended an APAS test before planning a pregnancy, and she was right—I was diagnosed with APAS. From that moment on, she took such good care of both me and my baby.

I remember feeling nervous and anxious before every appointment, but she always comforted me and encouraged me to pray. I trusted her completely. Before meeting her, I prayed to God to guide me to an OB who could truly help with my situation—after two miscarriages, there were moments when I felt hopeless. A coworker recommended her, and I’m so glad I listened. Today, I have an 11-month-old healthy baby girl. I still get emotional when I think about the whole journey, from pre-pregnancy to giving birth.

I also want to commend Nurse Ellen for her attentiveness and warmth. She never missed a detail, especially when it came to my medications and refills. She was gentle, caring, and genuinely invested in my pregnancy.

I am deeply and truly thankful for both of them.8:T525,Apollo Poly Clinic serves as a sanctuary for those reluctantly navigating the world of medical care. Though we may prefer to steer clear of frequent visits, life's twists occasionally bring us to its doors.

Overall, Apollo Poly Clinic transcends the mere label of a medical facility; it emerges as a haven of healing where quality care and personalized attention converge to offer solace and hope to all who pass through its doors.9:T56b,⭐ 1 Star – Extremely Disappointing & Unprofessional Experience
I had an extremely worst experience at iSmile Clinic.
The receptionist and nursing staff are highly unprofessional and behave as if patients are taking treatment for free or charity.
They provide false and misleading information over calls, and when you visit the clinic, the behavior is completely different. The staff talks rudely, raises their voice, and even shouts at patients and accompanying family members without any reason. Their attitude feels personal, aggressive, and totally unacceptable in a medical setup.
When asked to speak to higher authorities or management for feedback or complaints, no proper channel or guidance is provided. It clearly shows there is no accountability or patient-care system in place.
I was going through extreme pain, contraction-like symptoms, and abnormal bleeding, yet the doctor was unable to identify the root cause of the problem. Instead, I was subjected to multiple tests and continuous medicines without any improvement. After all this, I was finally told to consult another hospital, which clearly indicates poor diagnosis and lack of responsibility.
This clinic lacks basic professionalism, empathy, and patient respect.
I am deeply disappointed and would strongly not recommend ismail Clinic, especially for patients dealing with serious pain or gynecological issuesa:T5f0,Very disappointing and unprofessional experience at Dr. Ismail Polyclinic, Karama.

My parents visited the clinic today. My father, a kidney transplant patient, went for the first time, and my mother went for a follow-up visit after consulting a few days ago for viral infection and chest congestion. During her first visit, the doctor was polite and helpful, but today the experience was completely opposite.

The doctor behaved rudely and spoke in a very disrespectful manner about their insurance, saying things like “How come your tests are getting approved with such a low insurance?” and “I’m not making any money on this, only 20 dirhams — what’s the profit for me?”

My mother was feeling very unwell — she mentioned reduced urine output, sweating, and stomach discomfort — and only asked if she could get her medicines reviewed or a chest X-ray done. Instead of showing concern or professionalism, the doctor kept focusing on the insurance value and refused to help. Even when my father requested politely, they were denied support.

This was extremely disappointing and unacceptable. A patient’s condition and well-being should always come before financial discussions. Not everyone has high-premium insurance, but every patient deserves to be treated with dignity, empathy, and care.

I sincerely request the clinic management to look into this matter seriously. Such insensitive behaviour leaves a very poor impression and causes distress to patients already suffering with health issues.b:T4c9,I had an amazing experience at this dental clinic. They have multiple doctors, but I was treated by Dr. Nimmy Jose, and I honestly cannot recommend her enough.

She is incredibly patient, gentle, and careful. She always checked in with me, asked how much pain I could tolerate, and never pushed through anything without my consent. As someone who is very sensitive to words and tone, I’ve had bad experiences with dentists before—both here in the UAE and back in the Philippines—that made me dread dental visits. But with Dr. Nimmy, everything changed.

She reassures you, never blames you, and never forces you to do anything. Her hands are so light and gentle, which made a huge difference for me. I had a root canal, and although I was terrified because of all the horror stories my friends told me, the procedure was surprisingly smooth and far less painful than I expected. She was extremely careful throughout the entire process.

Also worth mentioning: the clinic accepts some insurance, and even if a service isn’t covered, the cost is very reasonable.

If you’re anxious about dental visits or have had bad experiences before, I highly recommend Dr. Nimmy Jose. She truly makes you feel safe and cared for.c:T420,🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Exceptional Dental Care Experience!
I highly recommend Manila Polyclinic Burjuman! From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warm smiles and professionalism by the lovely receptionists, Ms. Debbie and Ms. Kim. They made the check-in process smooth and welcoming, setting the tone for a great visit.

A huge shoutout to Dr. Rasha, the best dentist I’ve ever had! Her expertise, gentle approach, and genuine care for her patients are truly unmatched. She took the time to explain every step of the procedure, making sure I was comfortable and informed throughout.

Thank you also to Ms. Karen, the dental nurse, whose kindness and attentiveness made the entire experience even more pleasant. The teamwork between Dr. Rasha and Karen is seamless, and it shows in the quality of care they provide.

If you're looking for a dental clinic that combines professionalism, compassion, and top-notch service, look no further than Manila Polyclinic Burjuman. I’m beyond grateful for the care I received and will definitely be returning!d:T417,Vanilla Smiles Dental Clinic and Dr. Nair both are the BEST,
I had not seen such a professional doctor until now.

I was there for my Jaw Pain Treatment, and the pain was popping out all of sudden when i used to chew, I was not able to eat, Dr. Nair’s consultation and prescription helped me a lot, the pain went off within two days course. After a week’s treatment, now my jaws are back to normal and now I can chew like before.

Not only a professional, but Dr. Nair is also a great person by heart.
Also, the staff there, they are very friendly with a very good customer service attitude. What’s more, the consultation fee is ZERO.

Definitely I will recommend Vanilla Smiles Dental Clinic and Dr. Nair to all my friends and relatives. If there was a chance to give more than 5 stars, for sure i would have given that.

Vanilla Smiles Dental Clinic and Dr. Nair are a blessing for this society.
I salute Dr. Nair for his good work, please keep up the good work sir.

Thank you very much vanilla smiles team and Special Thanks to Dr. Nair.e:T4dc,I wanted a dentist near my place and I found this in the Internet as part of a group of clinics, one of which I visited before. I didn't like my first dentist so I was kind of apprehensive to try a new one.

So I tried my luck. Dr. Nair, the orthodontist in charge of me, was very helpful even though I knew I was kind of impatient to get my treatment done fast because.. I've been wearing my braces for so long.

I liked how the staff would always give me a call before the day of my appointment and it helped in keeping adjustments on track. Payment terms were easy since I could pay by cash or card.

While there are times I had to wait for my turn despite having an appointment, I understood that some patients take longer to finish and I do know that my session wouldn't be rushed as well.

Contacting them is also easy since they do give me a call back if they weren't able to answer it though I rarely had to call anyway.

They're friendly enough and the waiting area is cozy and clean.

I've already recommended this clinic to a couple of my friends and family and I'm hoping they keep at this level of service or become better. I'm mostly happy with the result of my treatment and thankful I stumbled upon them last year. Easy 5 stars.f:T48d,I don't usually do reviews, but this time I have to. Last week, during Eid day I was suffering from excruciating pain due to dental related issues. Actually, the pain started 2 days before and got worse on Eid day. I was so in pain and started desperately searching for Dentists who were open on the day. Most of them were closed. To the grace of god, I found one clinic which was open in Karama and the name was MIH Dental Clinic. It was one of my best decisions to choose this clinic for my treatment. From the first call onwards all the staff were too friendly and caring. They tried to comfort me while I was in pain. Then I consulted Dr Yasir in this clinic. He was so good at what he does. My teeth has to be removed through a surgical process and it was a time consuming task. However, he showed ultimate patience while extracting my tooth. He gave much care to reduce my suffering. He was never in a hurry, took time and extracted the tooth successfully. I will give him 10/10 rating. And after all this best services, he gave me a discount too. Honestly, I was very happy even without any discount. Overall, this clinic deserves nothing less than a 5 star.10:T4e0,Alhamdulilha 😍Excellent Dental Experience at MIH Clinic – Highly Recommend Dr. Yasir and Team!

I had been struggling with serious dental issues – one of my teeth was dead, and the alignment of my other teeth was not proper from normal theeth. This made me feel very self-conscious, especially when smiling or talking to others. I lost a lot of confidence because of it.
Then I visited MIH Clinic, and I can confidently say it was one of the best decisions I’ve made. Dr. Yasir is a highly skilled and genuinely kind person. He spoke to me in a very friendly and reassuring way, which immediately put me at ease. The entire team at the clinic is supportive and professional, creating a very comfortable environment.
Thanks to Dr. Yasir, my teeth have been treated far better than I expected.

😍Alhamdulillah, I feel so much more confident now and truly grateful for the transformation.
genuinely feel much more confident now. Another great thing is that the treatment was very affordable, which made the whole experience even better.
If you’re facing any kind of dental problem, don’t miss this clinic—especially Dr. Yasir. I’ve already recommended him and MIH Clinic to my friends. I’m truly grateful for the care I received.11:T903,Exceptional Orthodontic care for my daughter

As a parent, finding the right orthodontist for my daughter can be a daunting task. Fortunately, our experience with the Orthodontist's here has been nothing short of exceptional. From the moment we walked through the door of their clinic, we knew we were in good hands.

Every 6 month I visit UAE coming from the UK and I will never skip visiting this clinic due to the level of care and professionalism they are providing in everyhing related to dentietry.
I recently had teeth veneer procedure and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. The experience from start to finish was exceptional, and I cannot recommend their veneer services highly enough.
The clinic boasts state-of-the-art technology, which significantly contributed to the success of my veneer procedure. The precision and accuracy of their equipment were evident, and it reassured me that I was in capable hands.
The final outcome exceeded my expectations. The veneers seamlessly blended with my natural teeth, creating a flawless and natural-looking smile. The color matching was impeccable, and the attention to detail in shaping each veneer contributed to an incredibly realistic appearance.
The dental team provided comprehensive post-procedure instructions and follow-up appointments to ensure the longevity of my veneers.
Worth to mention that they placed 4 zirconia crowns perfectly which boosted my trust and I highly recommend them to anyone after the best quality and long lasting resutls.14:["area","karama","d"]

He can even eat foods that once caused him allergies.\n\nThank you, Dr. Subair, for your continued support and for helping our son.","time":"2025-09-26T10:16:54.316095046Z"},{"author":"Siona Jenisha Monteiro","rating":5,"text":"Dr. Soudai is an excellent dentist—very professional, patient, and knowledgeable.

Had very husky tone, almost lost my voice. Doctors from main stream treatment suggested for surgery and I was ready for the same having no other alternative. My wife, at times, was visiting Dr. Subair and she had insisted to discuss this issue with Dr. Subair before taking a final call for surgery. So, I visited Dr. Subair and he suggested that there is an option of very good treatment for this condition in Homeopathy and it may take around 3 months for considerable improvement from the current position. That's how the treatment started and slowly my voice came back. Within 3 months there was considerable improvement and by 6 months I was completely cured. Now more than 6 years has passed and I am doing fine. Heartiest gratitude to Dr. Subair from my family.\nBest Regards\nMalay Nath","time":"2024-12-28T07:23:32.619548Z"}],"types":["medical_center","hospital","point_of_interest","health","service","establishment"],"photos":["places/ChIJCaFXiydDXz4RARoFUrdkvW4/photos/AcnlKN0rxicRrCDxzafh0x6aJLoPQaP8nPRGksPT-uqdv03SuNeBjDdWGIErVYMKaN7E-hNXT974_ZjAIHgdj3aG5HXWnEvw-uMzJK6iBf0vsCsjE7D-4veoQs7e7Bj5wDMCjkcfq9m5IqwqJjjwDzoO3inlPvahQ88o9ktpOgiPcnub61mdPq78fTPoBW5BLvBzZnF9RqWE0iNq24lf2zhtLaD8BhAFhSgmoLfUPHIylToHrLGoXQ0cO-Y92V0VHj3xX2-uG6rXJ8BbMBHiknXSfIyPpIVt23FfgEtgnTF5Q2cXYaJKCnvGCUjejlwRSg91XtD385bP6AHgHwmP75nmI_s6dIwSpKBlwXnllQnGb4wvt5SGF-vFg9SVS_fj3PPWJCViym7cen850p5oa0BGhxRLBswbgfLPK2SOry7DgLFTNA","places/ChIJCaFXiydDXz4RARoFUrdkvW4/photos/AcnlKN2WjqM05LCIOeI3R6H6tgkoZErbWvg2DqttlFz54gcDSZVj6G5DjfuDQNRAZLFA6coQl6BKHjmayMLM3OvRZIRwc4Vj-5bdvw1OiwN5OcdrAlCN1Ndemu-ZV5kdqphALDhBwO4yo0nOhLDTnFK_uCLYgUaG-prZQAWg_tJ0N2hJzuWkwIozMXjkI6OM3RSq8VtU7T72mVS15mhlMOBKINMzBq_wuX5oym_XnPKvtGekrEshVdezN2uYpfWdgS0gtiOPnZYdtb-wCKHNlSopDXHGWmbDPuUeAesB2RRZu0CYfg","places/ChIJCaFXiydDXz4RARoFUrdkvW4/photos/AcnlKN0qFJZ0xqCyh_9_tbiB4NDzIa56JKvQaotzS_0kobf1F0pkv1YQhBIjsT51BsjlLpi-7L9Jcp_bsHyCfCJQ1E4CyOXWqe2DF5XUx_u-BgvthOdt6RVAf4zGlwSrBXlN7nNrgPPr2BbjIOJXokj1e33BTmUojjTd42uFQkygObB_2TDHL4NVG4IpB8CIjvdiipOBd6hxn81eHdEiv1bN1827XHcCZb7uhiNTJxAJ8NevHC9U2i-xWRMulK3PDQrvmVcuZfkpDUe0dvGZqKtiODo4lWEx9WjNAc-leXsG92_FZw"]},{"name":"Providence Dental Centre","slug":"providence-dental-centre","address":"68W2+HMR - Kuwait St - Al Karama - Dubai - United Arab Emirates","area":"Karama","phone":"04 397 7498","website":"https://www.facebook.com/providencedentalcentre/","rating":4.5,"reviewCount":14,"services":["General Dentistry","Teeth Whitening","Root Canal"],"hours":"Mon-Sat: 9:00 AM – 9:00 PM","description":"Professional dental care in Karama offering comprehensive dental services.","lat":25.246478,"lng":55.301646999999996,"placeId":"ChIJG4UYvidDXz4RGsYkWwc1z4A","googleMapsUrl":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=9281695662744061466&g_mp=Cidnb29nbGUubWFwcy5wbGFjZXMudjEuUGxhY2VzLlNlYXJjaFRleHQQAhgEIAA","reviews":[{"author":"Miss R","rating":5,"text":"Excellent service!

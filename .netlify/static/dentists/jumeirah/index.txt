3:T463,I was under specialised care during the past year at Dr. Joy’s clinic on Al Wasl road and my experience with them was extraordinary. Starting with the ladies at the front desk, who always had a friendly welcome and a warm smile. From the very first consultation with Dr. Gagan, I felt at ease with his confidence and understanding of dental reconstructive surgery, which in turn, gave me courage to start with the procedure. In order to attach the implants, bone grafting was required which provided the necessary structural support for the implants. I can only say that Dr. Gagan is an EXPERT in his field and a huge recommendation to everyone. The second part was an implant bridge together with additional crowns, which was an amazing job of dental restoration done by Dr. Sarmad. The amount of patience he had with me was over the top. His calmly manner and polite attitude was very helpful, but what I really liked was that he is a perfectionist with an amazing attention to detail. Overall, the amount of professionalism of the whole team at the clinic gave me was incredible and I can’t thank them enough for it.4:T529,Went to emergency for my brother who had a case of food poisoning. We waited almost over an hour to see a doctor who just recommended an V drip, antibiotics and three kinds of meds for stomach cramps. The first nurse couldn't find a visible vein in the elbow so they had to do it through the hand. She missed the vein at the first prick and it wad done with  a not-so-gentle manner that my brother said he shouted in pain. What shocked my brother was the nurse's reaction. She got upset and asked " what can I do?!" as if it was my brother's fault, looking angrily at my brother behind her spectacles. She left without stopping the bleeding from the prick to look for someone else to do the job. Without any apologies. He had to ask three times for her to put a bandage on his bleeding hand. Which was surprising as most Indian nurses are usually kind. And caring. I mean, isn't that part of their job?  The second one was also an Asian but he wasn't any gentle. Same pain but at least it was in the vein. My brother asked him if he just wanted to finish the job and not care about the patient's wellbeing. There were only a total of four patients present. I will not recommend going there unless it's a life-threatening situation and it is the nearest that you could manage. Very very bad services from the night nurses.5:T44d,I had an amazing experience with Dr. Preetham (Specialist Orthodontist) throughout my Invisalign journey. I began my treatment in June 2024 to correct an overbite, overjet, and crowding, and officially completed it in January 2026! I am genuinely happy with my smile, and the results went beyond anything I had in mind! 🤍

Dr. Preetham is incredibly dedicated, patient, and very thorough in explaining every step of the treatment. He never rushes appointments and always takes his time to ensure everything is done properly, which I greatly appreciate — especially his attention to detail.

I would also like to thank the wonderful dental assistant at the Jumeirah branch. She’s kind, welcoming, and always greets me with a smile, radiating positive energy ✨. She consistently checked in with me before and after each appointment to see how I felt about my progress or if I had any concerns. Her calming presence made every appointment comfortable and stress-free 🫶🏼.

If you have a similar dental concern or are considering Invisalign, I definitely recommend Dr. Preetham! 🙌🏼💯6:T44e,Dr. Maha Sultan is truly exceptional. She is not only a highly skilled consultant dermatologist and aesthetician, but also one of the true pioneers in aesthetic dermatology in the UAE. More than 10 years ago, she was among the first doctors to introduce chemical peels in the country. I personally underwent chemical peel treatments with her at that time, and the results were beyond amazing.

As a fellow doctor myself, I can confidently say that Dr. Maha combines deep scientific knowledge with innovation, precision, and an excellent aesthetic eye. Recently, I visited her again with concerns of severe hyperpigmentation and overall skin dullness. She carefully assessed my skin and tailored a meticulous, personalized treatment plan addressing every aspect of my concerns.

The results so far have been remarkable, and the improvement is very evident. Her approach is thoughtful, evidence-based, and results-driven, while always prioritizing skin health and safety.

I truly and highly recommend Dr. Maha Sultan to anyone seeking outstanding dermatologic and aesthetic care—she is simply amazing.7:T593,Feedback for Dr. Sweets and JTS Clinic

My experience with Dr. Sweets and JTS Clinic was deeply frustrating and extremely disappointing.
I have full psychiatric documentation from Brazil, including an official letter from my doctor, yet the clinic refused to issue a standard 30-day prescription — something completely normal and ethically acceptable in medical practice.
It became very clear that their system is designed to force patients to return every 15 days and pay for unnecessary follow-up appointments just to receive medication that could easily be prescribed monthly. This is not care — it is exploitation.

On top of that, the service was unacceptable.
Dr. Sweets was rude, disrespectful, and showed absolutely no empathy or ethical conduct when dealing with a patient who is already vulnerable.
As a psychiatrist, she should provide support, understanding, and compassion — but instead, she was extremely abrasive.
When I tried to understand the reason behind the refusal and asked legitimate questions about my own treatment, she simply reacted rudely and asked me to leave the consultation room.

It is both disappointing and concerning to see healthcare professionals behave this way, prioritizing profit and arrogance over respect, humanity, and genuine patient care.
I sincerely hope the clinic reevaluates its conduct and learns how to treat patients with the basic dignity that every person deserves.8:T42a,Unprofessional clinic with shady pricing and zero accountability.
1.	Front desk behavior: The receptionist was rude and made flirtatious/inappropriate comments during check-in. That’s not “friendly service.” It’s unprofessional and uncomfortable in a medical setting.
2.	Pricing bait-and-switch: I came in for a filling and asked for the price first. The dentist brushed it off with “don’t worry about it.” After the procedure, I got hit with an unexpected charge of about $250 for one filling. If prices “vary,” you still disclose them before doing the work, especially when the patient explicitly asks.
3.	The so called “Clinic Supervisor” made it worse: After I posted my review, the clinic supervisor contacted me and basically acted as the doctor’s lawyer, excuses, deflection, and irrelevant “free services” instead of a real fix. I asked for pricing transparency; I got a lecture.

At this point, it would be more effective to replace the supervisor with an AI agent that can tell the difference between accountability and excuses.9:T748,This was one of the most unprofessional and uncomfortable medical experiences I have had. Even though I always have bad experiences with the  nurses!
During the initial observations, the nurse taking my blood pressure allowed the cuff to tighten continuously without releasing. I repeatedly told her that it was getting tighter and painful, yet she did nothing. Another nurse then blamed the pain on the fact that I was wearing a jersey — something that could have been resolved by simply asking me to remove it instead of ignoring my discomfort. This showed a lack of basic competence and patient care. Because they kept having conversation woth each other instead of caring for the patients
After seeing the doctor, I was sent for a nebulizer, injection, and blood tests. At that point, staff unnecessarily accused my friend of taking videos when no videos were being recorded, which was confrontational and inappropriate.
The nurse who administered the injection then proceeded to write on my skin with a pen and circle the injection site. When I clearly stated that I did not consent to writing on my body and that I was uncomfortable, she repeatedly responded with “I don’t understand English,” despite having spoken English clearly just moments before. This felt deliberately dismissive and disrespectful.
To make matters worse, the nurses then spoke among themselves in another language and laughed, which felt mocking and extremely unprofessional in a medical setting.
Patients should never be ignored, blamed, mocked, or made to feel uncomfortable while receiving medical care. This clinic showed poor communication, poor professionalism, and a complete lack of respect for patient dignity. I would not recommend this clinic and will not be returning. I left without blood test nor the nebuliser as I didnt think they would be competent to help mea:T514,havior at Reception – JVC Branch"}
Dear Management,

I am writing to formally express my concern regarding the behavior of the reception staff at Karama Medical Center – Jumeirah Village Circle (JVC) branch.

The receptionist, a Filipino lady working at the front desk, has repeatedly spoken in an unprofessional and disrespectful manner to patients and visitors. I have personally observed that she gives preferential treatment to people from her own country while treating other patients unfairly. This behavior is clearly noticeable and creates an uncomfortable and discriminatory environment for patients.

As a medical center, Karama Medical Center is expected to provide equal, respectful, and professional service to all patients regardless of nationality or background. The reception area is the first point of contact, and such conduct negatively affects the reputation and trust of the medical center.

I kindly request the management to look into this matter seriously and take appropriate action, including proper guidance or training for the concerned staff member, to ensure fair and respectful treatment for all patients in the future.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I hope necessary steps will be taken to maintain the professional standards of your medical center.b:T46a,This is an honest review of the amazing Dr. Mayyas Joudi, Periodontist & Implantologist.
I went to the clinic to have all my wisdom teeth removed and was shaken up before going, because of a previous traumatic experience I had, back in 2021..
But Dr. Joudi can literally give you a whole new perspective, from the moment he walks in.
The confidence, high manners and kindness are pooring out of his pores. He's also calm and has a lot of patience and gladly answered all my questions and concerns.
I am beyond happy to have found an amazing dental surgeon after all these years and misguidance, here in Dubai.
My experience has been extremely smooth, it literally took him less than 2 mins to remove my tooth 🦷 and he did that, only after taking his time and making sure than the anesthetic injection took an affect already.
Words cannot express how grateful I am for Dr. Joudi. He's one of a kind and a skilled master of dental surgery. 🧑🏻‍⚕️🥼
Also, the clinic has a chill vibe to it and the staff are sweet, but most importantly, the Doctors are incredible!!
I highly recommend MyoSmile Polyclinic to everyone.c:T45b,I rarely write long reviews, but Montreal International Clinic deserves it.
Dr. Eman is genuinely one of the best dentists I’ve ever visited. Her hand is incredibly light — you barely feel anything — and her mix of compassion, care, and precision gives you absolute confidence that you’re in the best hands. She pays attention to every detail and always makes sure you’re comfortable and informed.

The entire team reflects the same professionalism. Sheena at reception is always welcoming, efficient, and greets you with a smile every single visit. Like most people, I’m not a fan of going to the dentist… but here I am, consistently coming back for my regular check-ups and maintenance because the experience is that good.
I also tried their Hydrafacial offer, and it was amazing. My face felt fresh, clean, and completely renewed. The technician Babyla was extremely professional and explained every step clearly, making the whole experience so relaxing.

If you’re looking for a clinic that truly cares about its patients — Montreal international Clinic is the place to go. Highly recommended!d:T44d,I cannot recommend this dental team highly enough. I underwent an extensive treatment that included 11 dental implants across both my upper and lower jaws, along with several crowns and temporary teeth during the healing period. From start to finish, the experience exceeded all my expectations.
The professionalism, precision, and care shown by the entire team were outstanding. Every step was clearly explained, I always felt comfortable and confident, and the healing process was handled with great attention and expertise. The temporary teeth during healing were excellent, both functionally and aesthetically, which made a huge difference in my daily life.
Most importantly, the final results are extremely impressive. The work looks natural, feels perfect, and has completely restored my confidence. I am genuinely so satisfied with the outcome and grateful for the skill and dedication of everyone involved.
If anyone is considering implants, crowns, or complex dental work, I would recommend this clinic without hesitation. They truly deliver exceptional results for a very competitive price .e:T493,A True Artist & Careful Perfectionist - My Smile is a Masterpiece!

I cannot recommend Dr. Stanislav enough. From start to finish the work he did is outstanding.

Dr. Stanislav is not just a dentist; he is a true artist and a meticulous craftsman. The final result is nothing short of a masterpiece—my teeth look incredibly natural and are more beautiful than I ever imagined.

What truly sets him apart is his unparalleled care and attention to detail. Every single step of the process was explained in a way that was easy to understand, leaving no question unanswered. He was incredibly attentive to my wishes, listened patiently to all my concerns, and dedicated a significant amount of personal time to ensure the outcome was perfect.

Furthermore, his skill and efficiency were remarkable. He optimized the entire procedure to be completed in record time, which I deeply appreciated, without ever rushing or compromising on quality.

If you are looking for a dentist who combines the highest level of technical skill with an artistic eye, genuine compassion, and a commitment to personalized care, look no further. Dr. Stanislav and his team are truly exceptional.f:T4a1,I came to Dr. Gorgina with concerns about old acne scarring that had bothered me for years. After a thorough consultation, she recommended a combined approach using Dermapen with Salmon DNA and RF Microneedling with Salmon DNA.

From start to finish, the experience was outstanding. The clinic was impeccably clean, and the entire procedure was performed in a strict hygiene environment, which made me feel completely safe.

The results have truly exceeded my expectations. After completing the prescribed sessions, my scars have improved by approximately 60%. The texture of my skin is smoother, the depth of the scars has reduced significantly, and I finally feel confident in my skin again.

Dr. Gorgina is not only highly skilled but also very attentive and patient, taking the time to explain every step and manage my expectations realistically. Her expertise in combining these advanced technologies for optimal scar revision is evident in my results.

If you are considering treatment for scars and want a doctor who is professional, knowledgeable, and works in a pristine setting, I highly recommend Dr. Gorgina. This has been one of the best investments I've made for my skin.10:T6a5,I am writing to express my heartfelt appreciation for the exceptional service and care I received during my recent visit for the implant procedure Dr.Shadi Alshaikh dental clinic. From the moment I stepped in, I was greeted with warmth and professionalism, a testament to the great team you have nurtured.

The procedure itself was handled with an outstanding level of expertise and precision from Dr.Shadi, which significantly allayed the anxieties typically associated with dental procedures.

Furthermore, the state-of-the-art facilities and the cutting-edge technology employed ensured that the procedure was conducted smoothly, showcasing the clinic’s commitment to offering the highest standard of dental care.

I must mention that my experience was greatly enhanced by the empathetic and attentive nature of your team. Their readiness to assist and their constant reassurance made a world of a difference in my overall experience.

As someone who has now experienced first-hand the great heights of professionalism and expertise that your clinic operates at, I am not just relieved but genuinely happy to have chosen your services for my implant procedure.

As I continue to admire the great work done, I feel it is only right to express my deep gratitude for providing such a splendid service, turning a routine procedure into a remarkable experience. I look forward to recommending your clinic to family, friends, and acquaintances with the utmost confidence, and I am eager to return for future dental needs.

Thank you once again for showcasing the epitome of dental excellence. Here's to a team that truly goes above and beyond in ensuring the comfort and satisfaction of their patients!11:Tac1,I had an extremely troubling and unacceptable experience at the Al Nakheel Branch of Dubai London Clinic & Specialty Hospital when my child had a severe allergic reaction.

When we arrived, they first measured his oxygen saturation and listened to his lungs with a stethoscope. The doctor said he was fine, but I clearly saw the same signs my child had during a previous severe reaction a year ago: a change in voice, vomiting, severe abdominal pain, difficulty breathing, drooling, and nasal discharge. I told the doctor that my child was having a severe allergic reaction and that we needed to administer the EpiPen. However, he insisted that it was not necessary and that nebulized adrenaline would be enough, telling me my child was fine, even though I knew these were clear symptoms of a severe reaction.

When I insisted that my child needed the EpiPen (as per standard protocol for his condition), the doctor dismissed my concern and left the room. He put me in a position where I had to argue for the correct treatment. He questioned my judgment and made me doubt myself, asking me repeatedly what I wanted as if it was not an emergency, despite me clearly explaining that my child had a history of severe reactions and needed the EpiPen, which another clinic had correctly administered in a similar situation a year ago.

In the end, the doctor did not assist in administering the EpiPen. I had the EpiPen with me the entire time and was simply asking for it to be applied. He only told the nurses to do it, but they did not know how to handle it properly and clearly stated that they did not even know how to remove the EpiPen from its plastic container. As a result, the EpiPen was not administered at all. neither by the doctor nor by the nurses. I was desperately asking for help because I could not do it alone, and instead I found myself having to instruct them while my child was in distress. The entire situation was chaotic and dangerous, and I ultimately had to leave the clinic and seek help elsewhere because I felt that my child’s life was not being prioritized.

I want this review to be a warning: this clinic did not follow basic emergency procedures for a severe allergic reaction and instead left me to figure it out myself. I cannot recommend them and urge others to be cautious.

This happened on December 10, 2025, around 6:00 to 7:00 PM.

Ultimately, I had to leave the clinic and seek help elsewhere, administering corticosteroids myself before rushing out. Thank God, giving him additional corticosteroids bought us some time to reach another hospital, where they handled the situation properly and my son spent the night admitted for observation. This delay and lack of proper care could have had severe consequences.12:T4d7,I had an appointment today with gynecologist XXX ( I was called and asked to remove the name of the doctor because it’s illegal) — a very rude woman. She didn’t even offer me a seat. I’ve been having discomfort in my breast for the past 10 days, and I came to get a prescription for a breast ultrasound.

She greeted me by saying, “You had an ultrasound less than a year ago.” Despite me explaining that I was in pain, she refused to issue a prescription. Excuse me, but I wasn’t asking for Xanax or a dinner invitation — it’s just an ultrasound.

With all the campaigns about Pink October, it’s shocking that doctors still refuse to assist patients who want to get checked. Considering that I have insurance that costs 40,000 AED, and that this rude woman isn’t even the one paying for the ultrasound, I’m extremely disappointed with your clinic’s service.

I do not recommend this clinic to anyone who expects professional and compassionate medical care.

Now, I am editing this review: After I posted it, I received a call from a clinic, telling me that I cannot place a doctor’s name as it’s illegal and that I was wrong, doctor asked me to sit 🤣🤣🤣. Not even an apology. Perfect customer service.13:T492,We had such a wonderful experience at New York Dental Clinic, and I’m genuinely grateful we found this place, especially because Dr. Diksha works here.

My daughter previously had a traumatic dental treatment, so she was very scared and anxious about going to the dentist. From the first visit, Dr. Diksha was incredibly patient, calm, and kind. She didn’t rush anything. She spoke to my daughter in a way that made her feel safe, kept her engaged, and helped her become comfortable and cooperative.

We came in for a checkup and cleaning, and later my daughter needed a ceramic crown. What I appreciated most is that Dr. Diksha was clearly committed to making it as pain-free as possible. Even during the crown process, she was very thoughtful about my daughter’s limits. She was willing to break the treatment into multiple sessions so my daughter wouldn’t feel overwhelmed.

I also want to mention the receptionist and front desk team, they were really nice, responsive, and caring with kids. I honestly can’t recommend Dr. Diksha at New York Dental Clinic enough. We’re so thankful to have found her, and I will absolutely recommend her to other parents.14:T575,I have been extremely satisfied with the care and service provided by Dr. Joy Dental Clinic, particularly at the Jumeirah Golf Estates branch. Both of our children are undergoing orthodontic treatment, including braces and several extractions, and every aspect of their care has been exceptional.

The dentist, Dr. Duaa handled each procedure with remarkable gentleness — one child required four extractions and the other five — and even routine cleanings have been performed with great attention and care. Dr. Akram is outstanding; I have complete confidence in his expertise and know our children’s smiles are in excellent hands. I was especially pleased to learn that he practices at this branch, as I had known him from a previous clinic and he was the orthodontist that I had originally wanted and valued but found inconvenient to visit regularly. I was thrilled when I learned that he had joined Dr. Joy’s. He is a perfectionist! He makes those Hollywood smiles!

The reception team deserves equal recognition. They are consistently friendly, professional, and accommodating, always making an effort to work around our busy schedules. Their warm and welcoming demeanor makes every visit a pleasant experience.

Overall, our experience with Dr. Joy Dental Clinic has been exceptional in every respect. I would highly recommend this branch for both general and orthodontic dental care.15:T42a,Unprofessional clinic with shady pricing and zero accountability.

I would like to leave a very positive review for Noa Dental Clinic, as this clinic has truly changed my daily life and my oral health.

First of all, a huge thank you to doctor Shikha who performed a deep cleaning (deep scaling) for me. Thanks to the exceptional quality of her work, she literally saved my teeth. I had been suffering from persistent pain for nearly three years, and after several months, the results are still strong and long-lasting. I am extremely grateful for her professionalism, precision, and expertise.

I would also like to thank Dr.Suhail, who demonstrated great clarity and judgment in his diagnosis. Before considering an extraction, he advised me to undergo a deep cleaning with the first doctor. This decision was crucial: not only did it help me avoid an unnecessary extraction, but it also relieved severe pain that had been affecting my quality of life for a long time. His thoughtful and honest approach truly deserves recognition.

Finally, a big thank you to Dr. Anupama for her advice, follow-up, and ongoing support. Thanks to her, I was able to optimize my oral hygiene, and today I feel extremely well, reassured, and confident about my dental health.
I highly recommend this clinic without hesitation !17:T597,I recently visited the clinic for dental treatment, and I have to say it was one of the best experiences I’ve ever had at a medical facility. From the moment I walked in, I felt welcomed and comfortable, almost like being among family.

Dr. Ivana Milic is truly exceptional — she not only provided excellent treatment but also explained everything in detail and made sure I was at ease throughout. Her gentle approach and professionalism gave me so much confidence.

Sister Rajeswari and Sister Sheela were both so caring and supportive. Their kindness and constant attention made the whole process smooth and stress-free. They really went out of their way to make sure I was comfortable, and their warm personalities created such a positive atmosphere around the clinic.

I would also like to mention Hisana, the insurance coordinator, who was extremely helpful. She guided me through all the formalities with so much patience and made what is usually a complicated process feel effortless.

Altogether, the team works in such harmony and creates an environment that feels more like home than a clinic. Instead of feeling nervous about dental treatment, I walked away feeling cared for and thankful. I truly appreciate the effort and dedication of Dr. Ivana, Sister Rajeswari, Sister Sheela, and Hisana. I highly recommend this clinic to anyone looking not just for great treatment but also for a warm, family-like experience.18:T694,I’m so happy with my healthy teeth, natural color, and beautiful smile! 🦷👍🏼

I’m truly grateful to Dr. Mohamed Koleilat, Dr. Aziz Lammam, and the entire clinic staff for their exceptional care and service. I also appreciate the other doctors who were welcoming to all patients.

Special thanks to:
•	Dr. Mohamed Koleilat – He performed multiple dental surgeries for me, including tooth extraction, dental implant placement, gum surgery, and deep gum cleaning. Thank you, doctor, for protecting the health of my teeth and gums with such skill and care. You are one of the best dental surgeons I’ve ever met! (أفضل جراح أسنان وعلاج اللثة)
•	Dr. Aziz Lammam – He accepted the challenge of removing an old implant and was incredibly cooperative throughout the process. He provided honest consultations, offered me several temporary dental options, and worked closely with the lab technician to help me choose the veneer color that best suited me. Thanks to him, I’ve regained my confidence when smiling. (صادق في الاستشارة وساعدني في اختيار اللون المناسب للابتسامة)
•	The Nursing Team – Always kind and supportive.
•	Reception Team – A big thank you to Ms. Nada, Ms. Asma, Ms. Abeer, and Ms. Vanessa for their warm and professional service.

And I can’t forget to mention how helpful the valet parking staff member was 🚗.

If you’re looking for experienced doctors, honest consultation, top-quality materials, and excellent communication, I highly recommend this clinic!

I shared my before and after photos (no filter) and they handled everything with great professionalism19:T493,Dr. Suhel is an amazing dentist; patient, empathetic, and truly dedicated. He now treats my whole family, but I first met him when looking for help for my 7-year-old son, who had always been terrified of dentists. Even a simple check-up or cleaning used to be a struggle, to the point where I had to hold him during treatments. It felt closer to torture than routine care.

With Dr. Suhel, everything changed. I discovered him through an Instagram ad where he shared a gentle technique using nitrous oxide (laughing gas) to calm children. It worked wonders — my son’s fear disappeared, and for the first time, dental visits became stress-free. Now he even looks forward to his appointments, happily sitting in the chair watching TV while the doctor works, without pain or panic.

This transformation has been incredible to witness. Dr. Suhel’s patience, kindness, and innovative approach make all the difference. I truly wish more pediatric dentists used this method instead of letting children grow up with fear of dental care.

I highly recommend Dr. Suhel to any parent whose child is anxious about the dentist. He turned our dental experience around completely.1a:T6eb,I can’t say enough wonderful things about our pediatric dentist. She has truly become a part of our family over the years, and I feel so fortunate to have found someone who not only provides exceptional care for my three kids but also makes every visit a positive experience. From the moment we walk in, her warmth and friendliness make my children feel completely at ease. It’s amazing to see how they don’t dread going to the dentist—coming home from an appointment feels more like a friendly visit to see someone they genuinely enjoy, who just happens to be checking their teeth.

What I appreciate most is her unwavering patience and thoroughness. She answers every single question we have, no matter how small, absurd or repetitive, with such depth and clarity. It’s clear that she genuinely cares about both the well-being of my children and the peace of mind of us as parents. I never feel rushed or brushed aside; she takes the time to ensure that we fully understand everything. We trust her completely with our kids’ dental health, and that level of trust means everything.

Beyond just dental care, she truly sees my kids as little people and always goes out of her way to make sure they’re comfortable and happy during each visit. She even makes it a point to ensure they get to their after-school activities on time, as promised, which we really appreciate as busy parents.

Her commitment to her patients is unmatched, and we always leave feeling confident and reassured. If you’re looking for a pediatric dentist who combines professionalism with warmth and makes each visit an enjoyable experience, look no further. We are incredibly grateful for her and the positive impact she’s had on our kids’ dental health and overall experience!1c:["area","jumeirah","d"]

The team at Micris Dental Clinic is truly exceptional.\nTo everyone in Dubai , you are fortunate to have access to treatment here that many of us could not find in our own countries.","time":"2025-10-27T14:14:58.028283862Z"}],"types":["dental_clinic","dentist","medical_clinic","doctor","health","point_of_interest","establishment"],"photos":["places/ChIJzeYcUf5DXz4RhqaFTaTLVwE/photos/AcnlKN2KG71_o_5sfzailPntzSj0_A5e0TejjUWrgeLrMZI71b8b22D49a1t36OGEBNdEyOWA6j6s_xO_kymxNpnoOapoZlrAqo0_GCdXXMEjxnCit5iBlOUQdiW_ipFl7dSWw5SliJ0CDk5P90I84k_OYnXaWs6iArstK2pfGzA4ARgtX0fz1cgGhuBI0ave3e3PxAcMx8XR3KzWSAfQu2mdT2xmdKlQME2hVcvwTEOnyGp-Ig81pV4Iv9LlPOlypngpTZ7xDW70z5fnf8p_l6K-Ak64MR2zH5c27lcx91Z7ACAQw","places/ChIJzeYcUf5DXz4RhqaFTaTLVwE/photos/AcnlKN1B0aktmTUrKeYFXyQEXxCio-G2UQIkQfk9i72NLqt-gejg7WC7WmwxxIemRczlhU5UE-zQXN7K8Vz7aBBSSZNorUjmcBHQ7snCqabAT1daOY95vHD6nAzXDsB2P61_h1g7p8l2arUMx843FUESq_NiaKiIT1P9zes5Bbh45rHxuV7Q4_lv8lHXKQo2h8ApoKPGUk3oo-KvTecuGIzkCBNVKQ0Upx3DOcUUvhVIxE6m6wsMUo40S2Vdlf5pOM-njL6tR5jB9q-4yIRwKsRmxcat8NLvBKDxS3irfydkaJ0QsHVKqIT35Pjd9dt82pz3XSOpl-xAPKK4GjszWQHH8sTQBtqoz1JAX0emFiTN6hwSNr8osmtkmfQ0e9HzPQZWX_fF-Ti9r00I3jm8NBp3mWnjj24LacVZ-saqSbhbBgoBVK0","places/ChIJzeYcUf5DXz4RhqaFTaTLVwE/photos/AcnlKN3UuUjZ0dDu46nlS2B3zDqijuEHrNWLQ2F14qX2TG-8JiEfN5gsk--rWJVC0ta_dUUubilZGySNK_LU0stcvWg75YmqUrP2fjFlOb4wAz_ypSoSJlzy0a_uUl_eEMOf85H-IHftq_oL8U3G4dSCKjVxuiaGeUTPdEcwmlJSmwsfzJdeLCFulHrfUKZLxKUwRmpuAk85yA_LzUpuaGkBAjLrgOvbOtetpjo2qApuN7dhagOn1YPLQCTP4bQRwdsDN0cZfeDP7aucanSyMMhdqZcoXrOh65bUUQrOQKuwgap_Pkw5pVft3_AH2Kptq3greQMjwkoFMWR6t4XDbaMJFm-5mOMVp4O0nEQzYQNLqqGKf1FfxjMUSIWyMWr_uriHpiEZkw5bXlCbCC_SzJol-x_7R3evYJzZh8u2jyvKqadAVQ"]},{"name":"Harmony Medical Center Dubai","slug":"harmony-medical-center-dubai","address":"Villa 491C - D94 - Jumeira 3 - Jumeirah - Jumeira Third - Dubai - United Arab Emirates","area":"Jumeirah","phone":"04 395 5113","website":"https://harmonymc.ae/harmony-mc-jumeirah-dubai","rating":4.9,"reviewCount":448,"services":["General Dentistry","Teeth Whitening","Root Canal"],"hours":"Mon-Sat: 8:00 AM – 8:00 PM","description":"Professional dental care in Jumeirah offering comprehensive dental services.","lat":25.179965,"lng":55.224207500000006,"placeId":"ChIJtU-LQj5rXz4RCx1gLfEjmck","googleMapsUrl":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=14526681591815609611&g_mp=Cidnb29nbGUubWFwcy5wbGFjZXMudjEuUGxhY2VzLlNlYXJjaFRleHQQAhgEIAA","reviews":[{"author":"Lex Malta","rating":5,"text":"Came on a journey of some days from Malta and decided to visit Harmony Medical Centre for a routine check up and dental cleaning.\n\nI am really amazed about the quality of service, the professionalism of Dr Klareta and her team together with the whole set-up.

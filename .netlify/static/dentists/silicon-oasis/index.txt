3:T6ee,This was our first visit to HealthHub, where my wife had a doctor consultation. Unfortunately, our overall experience was extremely disappointing.

After the consultation, we needed assistance regarding a laboratory test report. Contacting the call center itself was a major hassle, and the customer service was among the worst we have experienced. Instead of receiving timely and helpful support, we faced repeated delays, poor communication, and no effective resolution.

The laboratory report was not delivered due to an email address issue, even though the correct email address was clearly confirmed three times during calls with customer service. I had to call six to seven times requesting support and specifically asked to speak with the lab technician at the Silicon Oasis branch so the report could be verified and emailed. However, the team was unwilling to assist and instead kept explaining policies, which were neither helpful nor reassuring in a healthcare situation.

This entire situation could have been easily avoided with basic diligence or a simple courtesy call to share the report directly, but unfortunately there was a complete lack of human consideration.

Poor customer service in a healthcare setting only adds unnecessary stress, especially when there are already health concerns involved. Sadly, we did not receive any meaningful assistance, and the entire experience left us frustrated and disappointed.

Based on this experience, we sincerely hope HealthHub reviews and improves its customer service, the administrative team’s attention to detail in verifying customer contact information, and ensures that laboratory staff take customer concerns seriously and provide timely assistance rather than merely stressing policies and procedures.4:T55c,Dear friends, let me tell you about someone truly special: Dr. Cecil, who I believe is the best surgeon around.

When I found out I had a gallstone, I was honestly terrified. It's a scary thing to face surgery, especially when you're an OFW, far from the comfort of your family.

But I put my trust in the hospital, and I'm so glad I did. From getting my insurance sorted to having my stitches out, everything went so smoothly. The staff were just amazing – so kind and helpful, from the security guard at the entrance to the team at registration. They were always there to guide me, making sure I was okay and asking if I needed anything.

I have to give a shout-out to Elmer, my kabayan! He made every appointment a breeze, always with a smile and making sure I was comfortable. You're the best, Elmer!

But most of all, I want to thank Dr. Cecil from the bottom of my heart. I know how busy you are, Doc, but you always took the time to answer my questions, even the silly ones. I really appreciate that you treated me like a person, not just a patient, and that you didn't hesitate to give me your WhatsApp number when I needed to reach you. Thank you for taking such good care of me during my surgery. Eight days later, and I feel fantastic! I'll never forget your kindness and skill, Dr. Cecil. You're truly the best, and I'm so grateful to you and the whole team.5:T551,Honest review for microneedling PRP
Staff was friendly, booking and paying was easy
On the day of the treatment:
Doctor was able to explain the process, after care and effects, sets my expectation
Numbing cream was immediately put on my face while my hair is everywhere - I had to ask if they have a hair cap or anything for the hair
I thought there's a facial or pre-wash included knowing the procedure goes through deep layer of the skin but NO,  a reminder would be nice! I could have washed my own face.
Numbing cream was removed, the doctor rub alcohol to my face which the smell was so strong I had to breathe through my mouth.
The doctor started with the dermapen and I can sense some of the corner areas were painful than the other because the area was missed by the nurse putting the numbing cream.
After the treatment I told the reception my feedback and said because the rate is on promotional that's why it did not include facial, well at least inform!
All the impurities from the whole day without proper wash are for sure pushed down together with the PRP which is very UNHYGIENIC, I just don't understand WHY - you lack to provide info for better customer experience.
The only good thing I experienced is the nurse taking my blood which I didn't feel a thing.
Obviously I am going back since I bought a package of 3, well let's see how it goes!!!6:T4e5,Dr. Mohamad Abu Hawa is an outstanding dentist — gentle, empathetic, and truly a master of his craft. I am an incredibly anxious patient and usually fear dental visits to the point of tears, yet he remained calm, patient, and reassuring throughout the entire appointment. Thanks to his approach, what is normally a very stressful experience for me turned into a comfortable and surprisingly positive one.

The quality of the treatment was excellent as well. I had a filling done, and the result is precise, neat, and aesthetically flawless. I would also like to acknowledge his assistant, who was quick, attentive, and sincerely kind — a wonderful support throughout the process.

I also want to express my gratitude to the clinic for their understanding. Due to a difficult route, I arrived late (which is very unlike me, but Dubai is definitely not designed for smooth public transport). Despite this, the clinic accommodated me, and Dr. Abu Hawa still welcomed me warmly.

Overall, the clinic left a remarkably positive impression — clean, cozy, and with genuinely fair prices. Most importantly, it is home to a professional like Dr. Mohamad Abu Hawa, whose work and attitude truly stand out. Thank you for your dedication and exceptional care.7:T4a1,🌟 5-Star Review for Dr. Nighila at Shield Medical Center 🌟
I can confidently say that Dr. Nighila is the best dentist I have ever met. From the moment I walked into Shield Medical Center, I was met with warmth, professionalism, and genuine care — qualities that perfectly reflect Dr. Nighila’s approach to her patients.
She combines exceptional skill with an incredibly gentle touch, making every procedure completely stress-free. What truly sets her apart is her dedication — she takes the time to explain every step, ensures you’re comfortable, and treats you like family, not just another patient.
Her attention to detail, precision, and compassion make every visit a pleasant experience. Whether it’s a routine cleaning or a complex treatment, she handles everything with expertise and kindness.
If you’re looking for a dentist who truly cares about your smile, your comfort, and your overall dental health, Dr. Nighila is the one to trust. I’m beyond grateful for the outstanding care I’ve received — she has completely changed the way I feel about going to the dentist!
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Highly recommended — the absolute best in the field!8:T649,I would like  to share my exceptional experience with ACL Physiotherapy, particularly the outstanding support I received from Helna and Deepa. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warmth and professionalism that made me feel comfortable and confident in my recovery journey.

Helna's expertise is evident in her thorough assessments and personalized treatment plans. She took the time to understand my specific needs and goals, ensuring that each session was tailored to help me regain strength and mobility after my ACL injury. Her hands-on approach and encouragement were pivotal in keeping me motivated throughout the rehabilitation process.

Deepa's support was equally invaluable. Her positive attitude and knowledge made every session enjoyable. She provided not only physical therapy but also emotional encouragement, helping me push through challenging moments. The exercises and techniques she taught me were effective and easy to incorporate into my daily routine, which significantly accelerated my recovery.

The environment at ACL Physiotherapy is welcoming and supportive, fostering a sense of community among patients. The team genuinely cares about the well-being of their clients, which is reflected in their attentive service and dedication to helping each individual achieve their best possible outcome.

Thanks to Helna and Deepa, I am now back to doing the activities I love, pain-free and stronger than ever. I highly recommend ACL Physiotherapy to anyone seeking rehabilitation support. The expertise, compassion, and commitment to patient success here are truly exceptional!9:T4cc,Good Morning Apex DSO team 🌞🌻
It gives me immense pleasure in submitting my feedback here again for the second time and feel delighted in stating that after my root canaling and filling procedure, I am feeling perfectly fine. There is no pain or any other issue post procedure. My sincere gratitude and blessings to the team DSO.

Dr. Akansha Sonawane is excellent in her field, and she has God gifted talent. Thank you so much, Dr. Akansha for the treatment, care, and support extended to me during my 2 weeks of treatment at the clinic. Also, my sincere thanks to Ms. Ashna, for the very efficient nursing support and overall care given to me throughout the period of treatment. Further, I would like to thank Ms. Mitchell for her effective coordination and communication from the first day of appointment until the completion of the treatment.

I pray to God for the successful career of you three and the growth and prosperity in abundance. 🙏🙏 Good luck to the Apex dental clinic DSO for future growth and success. 🙏🙏

I am returning back to India in the coming week with a very healthy and positive energy and taking with me all these lifetime sweet memories. May God bless you all always 🙌🙌🙏🙏a:T497,Unfortunately, our experience with this medical center was disappointing.

My wife visited the center for a test. Although we already had a valid medical prescription from our private doctor, we were told that a consultation with their in-house doctor was mandatory as part of the center’s policy. We accepted this and proceeded.
We were informed that the test would cost AED 200 and the consultation AED 150, with a 20% discount available.

However, after completing the consultation and test the next day, we were surprised to be told that the prices had changed and that no discount would be applied. We were charged AED 480, despite the previous agreement.

Additionally, after waiting for the test results and trying to follow up, we received no response. We eventually had to visit the center in person, only to find out that the results had been ready for several days, yet no one informed us.

Overall, a very disappointing experience. We were planning to rely on this center throughout my wife’s pregnancy due to its convenient location, but due to the lack of transparency, poor communication, and poor organization, we will not be returning or recommending it.b:T428,I rarely write recommendations but when someone truly makes a difference, it deserves to be shared.

I want to express my genuine appreciation to Dr. Rachid Najim a talented and caring dentist who combines exceptional professionalism with remarkable humanity.

From the very first appointment, I felt completely reassured by his calm approach, attention to detail, and the time he invests in clearly explaining every step. He doesn’t only treat teeth, he treats people, with empathy, transparency, and a constant pursuit of excellence.

What stood out the most is his ability to:

•	Listen carefully rather than rush
•	Propose solutions based on long-term health rather than quick fixes
•	Create an atmosphere of trust, comfort and confidence

In a domain where many feel anxious, Dr. Rachid has the rare talent of making each visit smooth, educational and even pleasant.

To anyone looking for exceptional dental care, I couldn’t recommend him more highly.

Thank you, Rachid, for your dedication, integrity, and the positive impact you bring every day.c:T50e,I recently had the pleasure of visiting Trusmile Dental Clinic, and I must say it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. As someone who has always been a bit anxious about dental appointments, I was pleasantly surprised by the level of care, professionalism, and comfort provided by the entire team at Trusmile Dental Clinic.

Dr.Mariam and the dental hygienists at Trusmile Dental Clinic were extremely knowledgeable, skilled, and compassionate. They took the time to listen to my concerns and answer all my questions with patience and clarity. The dental procedures were carried out with utmost precision and care, and the team consistently ensured my comfort throughout the treatments.

Trusmile Dental Clinic was truly exceptional. The friendly and professional staff, combined with their commitment to patient comfort and advanced dental care, surpassed my expectations. I highly recommend Trusmile Dental Clinic to anyone seeking a dental provider who values their patients' well-being and delivers outstanding service. I have finally found a dental home that I can trust, and I will definitely be returning for all my future dental needs.

Thank you, Trusmile Dental Clinic, for making my dental visit a positive one and for prioritizing patient satisfaction above all else.e:["area","silicon-oasis","d"]

However, I feel very disappointed with the repeated negative experiences I’ve had with one particular Arabic receptionist.\n\nDespite being Arabic myself, I consistently feel uncomfortable and discriminated against whenever I deal with her. Her attitude is rushed, unprofessional, and unwelcoming. On more than one occasion, her aggressive manner and lack of understanding of my needs forced me to cancel my appointment altogether.\n\nInstead of listening and trying to help, her main focus seems to be pushing for higher payments rather than providing proper customer service or understanding what the client is actually looking for.

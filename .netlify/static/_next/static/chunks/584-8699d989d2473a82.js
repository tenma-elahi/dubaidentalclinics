One of its strong points is its adoption of advanced medical technology. In 2025 it was recognised by Newsweek as one of the “World’s Best Smart Hospitals” for its use of digital infrastructure, medical IoT, and tools such as robots, which help with navigation and pharmacy queues.  ￼ A growing urgent care clinic was also recently added to help patients with non-life-threatening cases, to reduce pressure on the ER and speed care.  ￼\\n\\nPatients often praise the hospital’s staff—nurses, physicians, and administrative workers—for being kind, attentive, and professional. Cleanliness is frequently mentioned, room service and the environment often get good marks, especially for private patient stays.  ￼\\n\\nHowever, there are consistent complaints. Many visitors say wait times are long, even when appointments are booked. Administrative or insurance delays sometimes frustrate patients.  ￼ Some complain about inconsistency in staff behaviour, especially in non-clinical departments, or delays in basic room services, or lack of clear communication.  ￼\\n\\n⸻\\n\\nVerdict: Aster Hospital Al Qusais is a solid choice if you want modern tech, good clinical care, and professional medical staff. But plan for possible delays, especially in administrative or insurance processes, and don’t expect everything to go perfectly smoothly. If time sensitivity or seamless service is critical for you, it may help to compare with a few other hospitals nearby.","time":"2025-10-01T17:03:01.205770612Z"},{"author":"Maria Tausif Shaikh","rating":5,"text":"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent Care at Aster Hospital!\\n\\nI am so grateful for the exceptional care I received during my delivery at Aster Hospital.

You have to bear long waiting time in my case 1 from Reception to GP. As most of the people are coming here on emergency basis for high fever and other GP consultations. Since no one like to Go to clinics in evening. It is always emergency or swear things. The clinic will act normal and keep you for waiting. Example : I have high fever and not even able to take sleep even after having meds properly so you are there for in case an emergency for IV to get a relieve from your pain. You still have to wait for at-least 2 hour and forced to sit on the available non- comfortable chairs and very small space for waiting area, even their Corridors are so small that you to wait for the person who is coming from other side. Place is so congested and peak hours are worst. It is my Second visit here in 1 year and they are same since then or maybe from the start. Last visit last for 4 hours at-least from 12am to 4am had only consultation and IV that’s it. Second visit is same came 6:30pm and still waiting for the nurse to call for IV room. At 8:10pm. At least they should consider the thing that patient have to get a vital signs check on ground floor then GP is on 1st floor then again come down for Reception payments if there is lab test required you have to go back to 1st floor for Lab and again last IV is in Ground floor.\\nIn current era all health care providers are focussed on hospitality and comfort for patient do they feel that they are here and they will get well soon, unlike they are just waiting for all things to get done and going home for peace","time":"2025-10-12T16:14:26.381487199Z"},{"author":"shabeer ali","rating":5,"text":"I have done the PRP sessions  from Dr Amrutha dermatologist .

The approval came at 1:18 PM, yet by 1:30 PM, we were still waiting while other customers were being served.\\n\\nWhen we approached the pharmacist Usama Ahmed, his behavior was extremely rude, dismissive, and unprofessional. Instead of addressing our concern:\\n• He stated that another client was from Emirates Airline and they have a contract with Prime — which is completely irrelevant and unacceptable.\\n• When we questioned the missing medication, he rudely told us to “read the prescription” and check with the doctor, despite being informed that the doctor had already left.\\n• He refused to contact the doctor or reception and said “it’s not my job”, asking us to resolve it ourselves.\\n\\nOnly after escalating the issue to the manager were we assisted properly. Another pharmacist at counter 3 contacted the doctor. At that point:\\n• Dr. Magdy stated that he did not write the beneficial bacteria because it is not covered by insurance\\n• He then mentioned the second nasal spray, which he had failed to prescribe initially\\n\\nThis raises serious concerns:\\n• If the medication is not covered, why were we not informed during the consultation?\\n• Why were we not given the option to decide whether to purchase it ourselves?\\n• How are patients expected to “know the name” of required bacteria or medication if the doctor does not prescribe or explain it properly?\\n\\nHad we not remembered and questioned this, we would have left without essential medication.\\n\\nThe most disappointing part is what happened afterward. We were promised a call from:\\n• The doctor\\n• A concerned/management representative\\n\\nNot to check on the patient’s health, not to apologize, not to resolve the issue — but only to inform us that we need to pay extra for the second nasal spray because it is not covered, which was the doctor’s mistake in the first place.\\n\\nThis experience reflects:\\n• Poor communication\\n• Lack of transparency\\n• Disrespectful behavior toward patients\\n• Zero accountability from both the doctor and pharmacy staff\\n\\nWe have been visiting Prime Medical Center for 2–3 years, and this is by far the worst experience we have ever had. The behavior of the pharmacist and the handling by the doctor were completely unacceptable.\\n\\nWe are extremely disappointed and will not let this matter go unresolved.","time":"2025-12-27T16:39:37.152620011Z"},{"author":"muhammad imran","rating":5,"text":"I had an excellent experience with Dr Hany  salim, perdiatrician.

We waited almost over an hour to see a doctor who just recommended an V drip, antibiotics and three kinds of meds for stomach cramps. The first nurse couldn\'t find a visible vein in the elbow so they had to do it through the hand. She missed the vein at the first prick and it wad done with  a not-so-gentle manner that my brother said he shouted in pain. What shocked my brother was the nurse\'s reaction. She got upset and asked \\" what can I do?!\\" as if it was my brother\'s fault, looking angrily at my brother behind her spectacles. She left without stopping the bleeding from the prick to look for someone else to do the job. Without any apologies. He had to ask three times for her to put a bandage on his bleeding hand. Which was surprising as most Indian nurses are usually kind. And caring. I mean, isn\'t that part of their job?  The second one was also an Asian but he wasn\'t any gentle. Same pain but at least it was in the vein. My brother asked him if he just wanted to finish the job and not care about the patient\'s wellbeing. There were only a total of four patients present. I will not recommend going there unless it\'s a life-threatening situation and it is the nearest that you could manage.

I came to him with a complicated orthodontic issue — my molar had been tilted inward since I was 12, and it had never erupted properly. I had sleepless nights with the sensitivity problems . I couldn\'t even drink water at normal temperatures or breathe cold air . Almost every dentist I visited in the UAE told me the same thing: “You need surgery, implants ” or “We have to remove your wisdom tooth\\" and some even mentioned my braces journey will take 5 years .\\n\\nBut Dr. Karthik stood out immediately. His calm confidence, deep expertise, and clear explanation gave me hope. I met Dr.Karthik through my friends referral and I was hopeless when I was going but I came back with so much happiness . Dr.Karthik was the only one doctor who told we can do this procedure without a single surgery . Instead of rushing to surgery, he used his advanced understanding of dental physics and biomechanics to gently guide the tooth into place. What many said was “impossible” or “too complex,” he handled with precision and patience.\\n\\nThroughout my braces journey, he monitored every detail carefully. His ability to solve complications, his commitment to getting the perfect result, and the genuine care he shows for his patients truly set him apart.

I also noticed that several nurses appeared uneasy during this situation.\\nDue to this lack of proper coordination, transparency, and respect for patients’ time, I decided to leave and requested the cancellation of my insurance approval.\\nThe only reason I have continued visiting this branch is because of Dr. Sameer Adnan, who is extremely professional, respectful, and consistent in his approach. Unfortunately, experiences like this at the front desk negatively affect the overall credibility of the center.\\nI sincerely hope the management looks into this matter seriously and ensures proper ethical practices, clear queue management, and professional coordination between reception and medical staff.","time":"2026-01-25T16:23:52.552438306Z"},{"author":"Fouzia Muhammad","rating":4,"text":"They offere complete health packages for men & women which is good.

My partner and I both had Botox done (three areas each) and paid full price. Within four weeks, the results had completely worn off. When we returned, the clinic acknowledged that they had received a bad batch and told us that several other clients experienced the same issue. They assured us they would re-treat us for free, as it was their responsibility.\\n\\nFast forward 4–5 weeks after the complimentary correction, and once again the results had completely worn off. We returned today expecting the clinic to honour what they had previously admitted, that the treatment clearly hadn’t worked, twice.\\n\\nInstead, after speaking with the owner, the doctor and clinic manager informed us that they would only offer a “two-for-one” deal. In other words, I was being asked to pay again effectively for three full treatments despite the fact that the first two rounds produced no lasting results whatsoever. Both staff members openly acknowledged that Botox should last 4–6 months, and that ours clearly hadn’t, yet the owner refused to stand over it.\\n\\nI find it shocking that any reputable clinic would treat clients this way, especially after admitting the product failed not once but twice. Based on this experience, I absolutely cannot recommend this clinic.

Unfortunately, the recommended Doctor by my colleague was on leave so I opted for hydrafacial. While browsing the services they offer, I saw 4D face treatment. To my curiosity I asked about it and was convinced to try the treatment since my problem was dullness of skin, early signs of aging and uneven skin tone. Thanaa, was so patient to answer all my questions and did convince me to try it. I’m really happy after my first session. Looking forward for the coming months for my next sessions and to see the end result! I highly recommend Thanaa for your treatment as she will give you the best experience! The best part is, she will only recommend the treatments appropriate for you and not just sell any treatment for their own gain. Just a little heads up, it’s a tad bit painful.

After dealing with persistent shoulder and jaw pain for years, I finally found someone who actually gets it.\\n\\nWhat makes Nagham so different is her whole approach, she doesn’t just treat the pain, she looks at what’s causing it. She takes time to understand your lifestyle, how you move, what might be contributing to the problem. It’s this holistic way of working that really sets her apart from other physios I have encountered.\\n\\nShe is incredibly thorough and looks at how everything in your body connects rather than just focusing on the one area that hurts. She uses a mix of techniques, manual therapy and acupuncture, basically whatever’s going to work best for you. And it’s all backed up by proper expertise (she’s got a vast  number of years’ experience and qualifications including  traditional Chinese medicine).\\n\\nBut honestly, what I appreciate most is that she’s just lovely to work with. She explains things clearly without all the confusing medical jargons, she listens properly, and you can tell she genuinely cares about helping you get better. She’s patient, encouraging, and really takes pride in what she does.\\n\\nThe results have been brilliant, my shoulder and jaw pain have improved massively in a short period of 3 weeks.

My symptoms were dismissed as being “unlucky with periods,” and I was not referred for further investigation or to a specialist.\\n\\nI now know that hormone tests do not rule out endometriosis. After continuing to experience years of debilitating pain, I eventually underwent laparoscopy and excision surgery at Medcare Women & Children Hospital with Dr Charles Rafael, where both endometriosis and adenomyosis were confirmed very quickly via ultrasound and MRI scans.\\n\\nThese are complex and specialist conditions, and I fully understand that not all gynecologists sub-specialise in them. However, I believe patients should be referred onward rather than dismissed. Being told that nothing was wrong contributed to years of self-doubt, disabling pain and delayed treatment.\\n\\nI hope this feedback encourages greater awareness of endometriosis and adenomyosis and clearer referral pathways so that other patients do not experience similar delays in diagnosis and care.","time":"2026-01-14T21:47:17.140947337Z"},{"author":"Zumer Altintas","rating":5,"text":"Dr. Tetyana is an excellent family medicine doctor—professional, attentive, and very knowledgeable.

Later, we were told that the doctor would be available at 6:30 PM, and we agreed to wait. Our token number was 39. However, patients with token number 40 were called before us. When I questioned this, the receptionist said it was for another doctor. This information was confusing and felt misleading.\\n\\nAfter finally seeing the doctor, we were advised that my wife needed an injection and a blood test. We collected the prescription from reception and went to the sample collection room. A staff member there took our prescription and told us to wait, saying they would call us.\\n\\nWe waited for almost 40 minutes. During this time, several patients who arrived after us were taken inside before my wife. I repeatedly asked the staff about our turn, and each time I was told to “just wait, we will call you.” After asking 3–4 times with no clear response, I requested our prescription back as we could not wait any longer.\\n\\nAt that point, the staff informed us that they could not find our prescription and admitted it had been misplaced. This was extremely disappointing and unprofessional. They then took my wife’s ID, went back to reception, and reissued the prescription.\\n\\nThis entire experience showed a serious lack of organization, poor communication, and disrespect for patients’ time. Losing a patient’s medical prescription is unacceptable and can cause unnecessary stress and risk.\\n\\nI hope the management takes this complaint seriously and improves staff training, queue management, and overall patient care so that no other patients have to go through such an experience.","time":"2026-01-07T16:24:44.786472225Z"},{"author":"Jens Joseph","rating":5,"text":"I had a great experience with the doctor and the clinic during my root canal treatment.

The staff member took me to the room to start the treatment.\\nThe problem started when the hygienist made me sit on the dental chair in an unusual inclined position that I have never experienced in any dental treatment. I am a healthy 41-year-old who has visited many dentists for cleanings, and never have I been placed in a position where my legs were up and my head was down. I was not sitting—I was almost upside down, at a 65–70 degree angle, where I could literally see my legs raised higher than my head. This has never happened to me before.\\nI am not someone who complains, so I stayed silent and let the treatment continue. The cleaning took almost an hour—with no breaks, no rinsing of my mouth from blood and saliva, and no rest. I stayed in that upside-down position the entire time. It was clear her comfort mattered more than mine.\\nWhen the treatment ended, they wanted to take scans to check for cavities. As soon as I stood up, I felt extreme dizziness. I could not move and had to sit back down. I assumed it was from the position I had been in, but it did not go away. After a few minutes, when I tried to walk, I felt unstable—moving side to side. The nurse walking me to the scan room held my arm and asked if I was okay. I told him I was dizzy.\\nAfter the scan, the specialist doctor told me I needed further treatment. When he escorted me back, he also noticed my imbalance, even joking that my wife would think they did something to me. He brought me water and I sat next to my wife. I told her this wasn’t right—something was wrong. She assumed it was lack of food or dehydration, but I told her it was because of how I was positioned during the cleaning.\\nWe left, ate and drank coffee, and went home. As the day went on, I felt slightly better, but every time I turned my head or laid flat, the dizziness returned.\\nThe next morning, I woke up with the same dizziness. It was a horrible feeling—something I had never experienced before. After a couple of hours, it eased slightly. My wife suggested we see a doctor, but I told her to wait one more day.\\nToday, I woke up with the same symptoms, so I booked an appointment with a neurologist at Mediclinic Parkview Hospital. I was admitted through the ER and given a brain MRI. I was diagnosed with Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)—caused by tiny calcium crystals in the inner ear shifting out of place due to the abnormal head positioning during the dental cleaning.\\nI now have to take medication twice a day for 10 days and see an ENT specialist for follow-up treatment.\\nI am a man of faith and believe everything happens for a reason, that God protects us from greater harm. I thank Him always—good or bad—because what seems bad today may be a blessing tomorrow. But what breaks my heart is seeing my wife cry, blaming herself for taking me to this clinic, even though it is not her fault. That’s what loved ones do—they blame themselves.\\nI have never written a bad review in my life, because I know it can affect someone’s livelihood. But in this situation, I must speak out. I don’t want you to take your loved ones—your husband, wife, son, or daughter—to a place where you may end up spending an entire day in a hospital, worried sick and blaming yourself like my wife did.\\nAll because of a hygienist who does not care about patient wellbeing, treats patients like objects, rushes to finish, and prioritizes personal comfort over safety.\\nI have seen dentists all over the world more than half my life, and I have never had such a terrifying experience as I did at this clinic.","time":"2026-01-19T21:03:30.806698530Z"},{"author":"Аида Жуасбекова","rating":5,"text":"Dr. Wael is the best doctor I have ever met!

They simply get some of the results which a common man/woman doesnt understand, if we ask them for the better results, then say.. this is not covered in insurance and like that.... Trust me, I have one of the top insurances with me and even with that, they say, it doesnt accept for the approvals. So, funny. My bad, I visited this clinic for my normal checks and ended up like this. After so much fights in the whats app, they sent a result of another person... How can we trust these people. I wont never ever recommend to visit this clinic, the attitude of the staff.... so bad. While taking blood samples, that is another disastrous thing... needle goes in like a gun shot feeling...simply putting the needle in, they dont care whether you feel pain or not. There are many other clinics in International city and rather I prefer to visit them instead of visiting this clinic.\\n\\nPS: Since there is no option for a reply to your comment, I am adding it here.  I had called to your clinic before visiting and the receptionist said its fine and you can come over. I can understand if you had nt charged me and asked me to visit the clinic any other day and then do the payment, I could have understood that courtesy, this is like I paid the copayment and you asked me to wait for the approval - visit the clinic again, that was insane, you could have informed me about that before I did the payment. So, you didnt do that and then the mess up has started. Hence, I insisted to take the sample, because I didnt want to visit the clinic again for this, rather I prefer to visit other clinics. Please dont explain me on the feeling of a needle prick, me and my wife both of us felt the same and have bulged the part straight after that, do you know that. I never had that before- this is not the first time I take injection. I told the nurse that am a bit uncomfortable with the needle prick and still he did a rocket shot. Straight after the needle prick, my wife was murmuring to me - what kind of a nurse he is....And lastly, when I complained, you replied to me that, will check for the uric acid and shared a result of another patient, and that is certainly against the information security law. If you are not ready to send the result of mine - its fine, but sending somebody else\'s result, that is absurd.","time":"2025-11-11T17:09:57.552820003Z"},{"author":"mustafa bangash","rating":5,"text":"I had an excellent experience at Medlite Medical Center.

What really stood out was how closely they followed up with me afterward, always making sure I was healing correctly and properly. You can genuinely feel how much they care about their patients. The entire staff at Smile Story was also very professional, patient, and accommodating, which made the whole experience much easier. I highly recommend this clinic to anyone looking for skilled, compassionate, and trustworthy dental care.","time":"2026-01-07T12:57:54.604603206Z"},{"author":"REYNAN TAGAYONG","rating":5,"text":"I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to the amazing team at Smile Story Medical Center.\\n\\nA very special thank you to Dr. Greeshma for patiently and carefully maintaining my braces since May 2023 until I transition to my retainer.

In fact, my younger son who will likely need braces as well initially disliked the idea, but after accompanying his sister to her appointments, he is now much more comfortable and open to it. Dr Keerthan was also incredibly patient with my daughter as she took her time every visit choosing the colour of her braces because he understood how important a decision that is for a fourteen-year-old. He was polite and mindful when interacting with the kids and efficiently managed our expectations, having my daughter\'s treatment completed well ahead of school prom, which was her main concern.

All statements below are based on my direct interactions, medical outcomes I experienced with Cosmo Mirdif & American academy.\\nI have never had  such disappointment, distress, and lack of accountability from a healthcare facility.\\nI underwent a mummy makeover procedure costing 60,000 AED after being influenced by a marketing campaign conducted by Cosmo and direct communication with Lamis, who introduced herself as the assistant of Dr. A. Hazb. I was repeatedly told that Dr. A. Hazb highly experienced, delivered excellent results ,no complicationsBased on these representations, I trusted the process and proceeded.\\nSurgery & Immediate Aftermath\\nDespite requesting a quiet room, I was placed in a small, loud room. Upon waking from surgery, I noticed:\\nSevere bruising covering half of my back .\\nSmall unintended cuts on my abdomen\\nAn uneven abdominal scar placed approximately 5 cm above the bikini line, making  impossible for me to ever wear swimsuit nowadays as the scar is so visible\\nEarly signs of breast complications:\\nOver time, the results worsened significantly. The breast lift failed, implants migrated upward, and I developed double bubble deformity and snoopy deformity\\nHospital Stay & Discharge\\nAfter undergoing one of the most painful procedures of my life, I asked to stay longer and was willing to pay cash for additional nights. However, I was discharged after two days and literally kicked out  by a female manager (brunette, name not given to\\nMe who acts like she owns the hospital), who informed me that the hospital was full and that I had to leave.\\nI left the hospital in visible pain, crying, and without adequate emotional or medical support. The lack of empathy during this moment was shocking.\\nPost-Operative Care & Follow-Up\\nI was on strong painkillers for over two weeks. I received no proactive follow-up from Dr. A. Hazb. When I contacted him myself, messages were either ignored or I was told that everything would “settle with time.”there is no complication\\nInstead, my condition deteriorated. I developed:\\nThree post-operative infections\\nRetained stitches\\nIncreasing pain and swelling\\nDuring a follow-up appointment that I had to chase for, infections and retained stitches were overlooked.\\nI later consulted two other plastic surgeons within the same facility, who:\\nConfirmed the infections\\nRemoved leftover stitches\\nConfirmed that the procedure would need to be fully redone due to technical issues\\nWhen I requested my medical report, the hospital refused to provide it.\\nCommunication & Professional Conduct\\nWhen I raised concerns about the outcome, Dr. A. Hazb blamed me for the results, stating that I returned to work too early (after 13 days). During this exchange, I was spoken to in a humiliating manner and eventually blocked by the doctor, cutting off all communication and responsibility.\\nManagement Escalation\\nI escalated the matter to the hospital director (dr.Dyia) who initially addressed me as “sister” and said he wanted to help. Within minutes, the conversation shifted, and I was told he was too busy to take my calls and was asked bluntly what I wanted from the hospital.\\nNo resolution, accountability, or apology followed.\\nCurrent Condition\\nIt has now been two months since the surgery. I am currently dealing with:\\nA third infection at the incision site\\nOngoing pain and swelling\\nCancelled flights and emergency medical visits\\nSignificant emotional and psychological distress\\nAt no point did Dr. A.

Very unprofessional and dissapointing.","time":"2025-11-15T18:25:00.403972742Z"}],"types":["medical_center","dental_clinic","hospital","medical_clinic","health","point_of_interest","service","establishment"],"photos":["places/ChIJ6yCjPtpCXz4RUuIjkUePUjw/photos/AcnlKN3irUt91UL7Hgp6yf6hXfBFEdZIE9w61yk0zQqVZ_TrbhxtwxLl-4GT3ARhrFJw7U5GTXlrvI-YU-BC8qKJqGCOHEQZCYFxIDTgA1K2v6EqWWSjroDQhF-feMwOe221V5VQzUtaA14DUJxxS8eND0yfzrzEYqicifQ0DykQn5SlkQQ1sjOIZFX_WOJD9K7Prh2NBMYwpk6zP-_WCNaTDROggIj8vAa7kapCPg0BFMk-i8fPTEmEzgTEwyWkfUbfqe-7-zsbz7ID5RWh5bmBwG-5K5JnA7GRM1Od40Z45yRxmQ","places/ChIJ6yCjPtpCXz4RUuIjkUePUjw/photos/AcnlKN1W5owrwdOZ7gD1syvgGnfzetjbWTcEEHBv-b58idf0dAzq4_QETqTn72Xgkgza0ydqM-Na9Vy2l35ku-cx2z1SQSnh0EOIOwSWoKop_KR1-cSpDHmhB9HuHQsQGs_jZ9UfDvuWdyyTNPoDusjCmw7qlqFbtqRC4yIUbXhnxRQbVCLWrfBgD-Mh87WAKbG1tGoTds7rmWDk6dQteCDnR4p88u3Z2u6PFs-e_-_C6mTD8mMn5nMkAVluPPyOhEngH9hyOYs0H7uaZ-CRq_uViyGjgQscea0JLR-BCiQzM9luXw","places/ChIJ6yCjPtpCXz4RUuIjkUePUjw/photos/AcnlKN1gfRsu7r_yQTMcli2THMDojAm30hLWgCVR9FwSHqwOkkm8cnvO4DDPSJz1s4bRoXnnacBQ9wlAK0UnF2LwmFAJOwn3erq44igmVvtCafAW6vks7kwEu9TZu3LxdF8cpR9af2FwQ1vJBNtuf-CMiIvilArQMvFjP88RV1SYu8KD_lzJEEmLaMNYMV6VoTMSsB505gKrNkkald7vezWUIg1M4bUY5o_UufTjVpmMrjOz-I7LvaOWm4XmOQDE2zR4Qp8uJRs1PRiSbfBxStri9nEe9fYc2dpRusdl4dT26WME2HNvHoQiU5OMVwSWssi6aldPfwURe1imrYK8HNT0BQ2ueY6XG60SjEls7eAZCLLNV499PToNLs2v33hfkWNfa54K2JcZgUwBBpOAdsprLRFNY0DMCFKi9WRP6HoYsoSmeM0"]},{"name":"Leila Hariri Dental & Medical Aesthetics / ليلى حريري طب وجراحة الاسنان","slug":"leila-hariri-dental-medical-aesthetics-","address":"Villa 410 - Al Wasl Rd - Jumeirah - Jumeirah 2 - Dubai - United Arab Emirates","area":"Jumeirah","phone":"04 349 5432","website":"https://lhdm.ae/","rating":5,"reviewCount":420,"services":["General Dentistry","Teeth Whitening","Root Canal"],"hours":"Mon-Sat: 9:00 AM – 6:00 PM","description":"Professional dental care in Jumeirah offering comprehensive dental services.","lat":25.2062921,"lng":55.252873799999996,"placeId":"ChIJRzV8HJpDXz4RK07mIE6IjG0","googleMapsUrl":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=7893834116014427691&g_mp=Cidnb29nbGUubWFwcy5wbGFjZXMudjEuUGxhY2VzLlNlYXJjaFRleHQQAhgEIAA","reviews":[{"author":"Cecilia Morenes","rating":5,"text":"I’ve been visiting Dr. Anu for my dental treatments, and I couldn’t be happier.

I repeatedly told her that it was getting tighter and painful, yet she did nothing. Another nurse then blamed the pain on the fact that I was wearing a jersey — something that could have been resolved by simply asking me to remove it instead of ignoring my discomfort. This showed a lack of basic competence and patient care.

At that point, staff unnecessarily accused my friend of taking videos when no videos were being recorded, which was confrontational and inappropriate.\\nThe nurse who administered the injection then proceeded to write on my skin with a pen and circle the injection site. When I clearly stated that I did not consent to writing on my body and that I was uncomfortable, she repeatedly responded with “I don’t understand English,” despite having spoken English clearly just moments before. This felt deliberately dismissive and disrespectful.\\nTo make matters worse, the nurses then spoke among themselves in another language and laughed, which felt mocking and extremely unprofessional in a medical setting.\\nPatients should never be ignored, blamed, mocked, or made to feel uncomfortable while receiving medical care.

I was told elsewhere, based on an X-ray, that I needed a root canal. Since my symptoms didn’t match what I understood about root canals, I decided to seek a second opinion. After reading so many positive reviews about Dr. Ahmad, I booked an appointment and shared my concerns.\\n\\nFrom the start, he made me feel comfortable and explained all the possible scenarios. He took a new X-ray and was very honest, saying you can’t always come to a final conclusion just from an X-ray and that a closer look was needed. When I gave the go-ahead, he carefully investigated and confirmed that I did not need a root canal at all, just a deep filling. I was so relieved and grateful that he took the time to get to the right answer, sparing me from unnecessary treatment.\\n\\nOn top of that, he gave me one of the most thorough and gentle cleanings I’ve ever had. As someone with very sensitive teeth, I was amazed that he managed to clean my teeth and complete two fillings without anesthesia and with no major discomfort.\\nIt’s safe to say that I’ll only be visiting Dr. Ahmad at Bright Smile for all my dental needs going forward.\\n\\nA special mention also to the gentleman at reception, he was polite, helpful, and welcoming.

This was only explained after the procedure, when I pointed out that the stains were still visible. The doctor later acknowledged that this was his mistake. To make matters worse, the final bill unexpectedly increased to over XYZ AED due to a “consultation fee,” which was never communicated at the time of booking or before starting the treatment. This lack of transparency is unacceptable. I strongly advise future patients to clearly confirm both the services and the final cost in advance. The management needs to seriously improve communication and professionalism.","time":"2025-12-29T11:32:24.484030839Z"},{"author":"Karmina Andrea Lim","rating":5,"text":"I had my wisdom tooth extracted last Friday, and I’m truly grateful that Dr. Mubeen Zeeshan performed the procedure.

Just to discover that the price jumped to 950 and it was 1 session only. I asked to use Fazaa which clearly shows that the clinic is a part of, but they refused and said they didn’t renew with fazaa, which btw until now shows that the offer is available until 10-09-2026. After she did my root canal. I had the worst pain I had in my 38 years existence. And when asked for an emergency visit, they always gave me times that is hours far and I couldn’t go because of pain. After I visited again after 1 week for my second session, the doctor discovered that the real problem is between the tooth that she did and another tooth. That is why the pain didn’t go at all. At this point, I lost all trust and refused to do the second root canal there.

Unfortunately, I had requested Allergen botox, which is what I had always gotten in America and I knew worked for my very stubborn forehead muscles, but when I got to the clinic I was told it was sold out.\\n\\nUnfortunately, despite 4 re-do attempts, which the clinic so graciously allowed, my wrinkles in my 11\'s region between my eyebrows just never went away. I\'m convinced it\'s because they did not use the Allergen brand botox I had asked for.\\n\\nI probably wouldn\'t recommend them for botox, as my friend had a similar experience, but I\'m sure they\'re great at other services with their stellar reviews others have left. :)\\n\\nUPDATE: here is the message with me and their staff member showing Allergan was not used the first time. Ive gotten Botox several times in the U.S. for my 11’s, and my forehead was completely smooth and wrinkle free. Each time I went for my complimentary touch up here at Aries, days after my Botox was injected I notified the clinic immediately that it wasn’t working and they assured me to give it some time. While I appreciate them allowing me to get it touched up for free, as I mentioned - regardless, it didn’t work and neither did it work for my friend. I’m sure their other services like dental/facial are great but this is just my personal and honest opinion about their Botox for myself.","time":"2026-01-23T03:30:58.935048266Z"},{"author":"Presley L","rating":5,"text":"Have been coming here for a little over a year and has made such a difference in my skin, I absolutely love my services with Joy, she gives excellent facials and is always so kind.

My family, extended family, and colleagues have been loyal patients of this clinic since its early days. Back then, the doctors and management were polite, respectful, and the processes were smooth. Sadly, things have completely changed.\\n\\nThe clinic has now become money-driven. Doctors are refusing valid insurance policies, forcing patients to pay in cash, and even judging patients based on the insurance they hold. This is highly unethical and shows how little they value the loyalty of their patients.\\n\\nTwo weeks ago, I visited Clover with severe wisdom tooth pain. Dr. Dorcus examined me, prescribed antibiotics, and asked me to return once the inflammation was gone. I followed the instructions exactly, booked my appointment in advance, and returned after two weeks expecting the extraction to be done. To my shock, I was told by the staff that my insurance would not be accepted and I had to pay cash.\\n\\nThis was beyond frustrating. My insurance is a premium policy, and only six months ago I had three wisdom teeth removed at the very same clinic using this insurance—all approved immediately without any issues. If the clinic believed there would be a problem, why was I not contacted earlier? Why let a patient wait in pain for two weeks only to reject the procedure at the last minute? This is not just negligence—it is disrespectful and unprofessional.\\n\\nI am addressing this directly to Mr. Sameer, Head of Department: this is not how a reputed clinic should function. The lack of communication, the refusal to honor insurance, and the clear push for cash payments reflect poorly on your leadership and on Clover as a whole.\\n\\nClover Medical Centre has lost my trust completely. From this point on, I will no longer visit this clinic, and I will make sure my extended family and colleagues—who have been loyal patients for years—also stop coming here. A clinic that treats its long-standing patients this way does not deserve our loyalty.","time":"2025-09-05T22:41:38.916874871Z"}],"types":["medical_clinic","dental_clinic","point_of_interest","health","establishment"],"photos":["places/ChIJTfSJpXdrXz4RzJrieSe8BIc/photos/AcnlKN0vRGPcpEX3BQ5aI_bQXG1YQn4i8UtXsLIE-pgR-XjIFx6RkRYDHJUDRYImNniLxky6orbJJcaOiAlRwrHKW_wH_oGXZeJE4kdl9NNFczsX8-KZZAKl6bSJXQMvN58gID1WbPuwwc0swGCKTNKNRJSY_vN38hGBZUza94zLvRCuCNQ2d2tnXlgSW4RSBa2E8Rh9-ic0nYdrJ-BgXcIBFiaHF1tnVuiMMdUtiOynyKgoYphoG3KteCLzzXFSJo3swji35RXvFgbNOAMQkJtnU0eHvt0dOD4NvW23HBX5QWX0gg","places/ChIJTfSJpXdrXz4RzJrieSe8BIc/photos/AcnlKN3eiF8H60S4hmEZTYOQG7dDJKP4jnDFHPJFmkjQbe_cjEtKtD-tyJ5CL6QdnMvFO8N2plVOTNhGjpReX3tW2oeywW6BNQ9vUKdI8-Gk3F6HTSmZpX0qmiXv-KC0Lr6EOr7kSxcg8dqCseVhHLJNUQMwdTjmjStM7AzTGhQquxWPCG4m1JZOMqmJKP-vSGOSXNmxQXJEY3QXfQ8OwxxwZeo2XL7IdBykjdpBZZ_coJa9vOU-DsqLfSJqquxd6svkml5TRbBF6I-YLTlBgPD0LC-wJrCqnhYogkKJCemQI3CWlGGjIBiJeQqWJEPCygRZ2rY2iSXECO8We4AEFDwALGGveh1P9k21-zaj4UO94z8CuQx7pK9JIPJ6P32Y0hbLE1qFtF8IS382cf7q4O4PVu71Ls2W9VqvwUmj2LTUyXL6cI-X","places/ChIJTfSJpXdrXz4RzJrieSe8BIc/photos/AcnlKN2gs6ufjn7Q2asGgQdgMwwIMgxCUVYcpgJhFyZOwOxD0tIIJaNQsJs-4cYxDYzuAAfr3NAhLiQQBqFThVTblrL_amTVSiYh9se0kc_K-0DXgfKGUHCfWPoVefgz0rH7zBWSZOzEQ8Z8asTwf7AN8B7P98pNBHRX6OfQ7jDaL2H_W36Bjpc0yMyiuvzy1pAcEF2sspVGnpXeJRm1nXlrQby6q9ca0BSUaWi4irScd9p4fICMs551XgOrcXJ1IRDGeZv0i9G1pvAZO9gnLiRfmlsKsWWQ5y_kUXNqaEybtngy1A"]},{"name":"Omar Yahia Dental Clinic","slug":"omar-yahia-dental-clinic","address":"Fifty One Tower - Office 303 - Business Bay - Dubai - United Arab Emirates","area":"Business Bay","phone":"050 219 5151","website":"https://www.instagram.com/dr.omaryahya/","rating":4.9,"reviewCount":229,"services":["General Dentistry","Teeth Whitening","Root Canal"],"hours":"Mon-Sat: 9:00 AM – 8:00 PM","description":"Professional dental care in Business Bay offering comprehensive dental services.","lat":25.1898642,"lng":55.2844382,"placeId":"ChIJM8f94TZpXz4R3kZIi0BeHQU","googleMapsUrl":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=368554375821936350&g_mp=Cidnb29nbGUubWFwcy5wbGFjZXMudjEuUGxhY2VzLlNlYXJjaFRleHQQAhgEIAA","reviews":[{"author":"Sali Akkad","rating":5,"text":"We booked with Dr. Modar, a Syrian doctor who is very professional, honest, and kind.

Highly recommend this clinic for families!\\nThank you to Dr. Mona and Jenny and to all the staff.","time":"2025-09-23T07:17:33.616590054Z"}],"types":["dental_clinic","medical_clinic","health","point_of_interest","establishment"],"photos":["places/ChIJ9YVWcOBDXz4RqFqbGVuJZ1w/photos/AcnlKN2lBmOWQceTJsc6Aua97Dca_9BR-GywPUyKw6xrttA40KOsSQnTYINE_3TVBhM15jJcwqpZFndDt5AcGtrRxcI4RtvcsJBdewJ_HpFp1abrNOlayIgZAWuVUgH8BuPudEd36YGic5Ew3pnuAOhcbFiAvvK2Xf4a7V8__nNOsylo5LXIAGETHn_VGzZEWggeNYbwvdre4DReljTeUshhBOVXTOEvOwi5RZboJemionN3s3sb3WtwgwxmdkIozwnNTGyjQf4oy76SRpRd-esAufRh1H78xhY38XkqWy8G-1hmbw","places/ChIJ9YVWcOBDXz4RqFqbGVuJZ1w/photos/AcnlKN3x8BF7v5NmnDTS_PCkHmO--JPiB7f1JMBXuTYVDB71QWZ7H1u8N5IYYjQ27j8B0twkxUxjLVeKJYBAfHZNo9FFYOP5zXkoPYjjoXv9sGmwmQoeKoBI9dE1pYvk_qlNJugIT8bKDbqO5pWW-H1zeves41DJZmk3Gv_Dqb3oxSeSQMkQM8X2YWArwepdhAk9JljanOAAdlNrBQ6ko-k6KX2n385RxXv_c91FKj9QdBXZejuOLdQjW4xpmCd1fXiafnN9pVsd8GUrM-BQmAMiMrynoKp5xgBnz9759ByfCbiGWQ","places/ChIJ9YVWcOBDXz4RqFqbGVuJZ1w/photos/AcnlKN3YTewJJhyRDyFgMtH1fmxZY5ebiN_uJUhTcIr1LC4Ic2Oq59-rnjNN-x_vB3EmIeoUolW7oMOsWzwJF9q_X8IOFPOPdNe-A69AoHyW6Bw8xiAGFcV8OfQoJtrpiRCKuYsj121FtkW--ZIQXi_5o0P8n7l-Uv4QAycgt6d61hjPdB-Pt6Y8aA61UPY6kvIaYAR4AK3gsP8SrQfucsZC1K8UUMjWKspcM0txCY1uzoQSObpiqDmTKW8szVChqNhMxWgkkpdGjwPrm-8CV7Yh6BfQfdOQZYQ6ky-uWk1RAwL1eCmmIVV16QbtcTyeWBAnUr3LownRpNNvj0PAN4zrUCXQGoLj1kokMHAU6rB8nTcsCunNdmwtO9LSlbXU5ofutKBkaT2IWQ_Q8O2u7MDzntbu8XMJdbilENheqo2YegonpA"]},{"name":"Liverpool Medical Clinic | Bur Dubai | Gynaecology| Paediatrics | General Medicine | Dental | Physiotherapy | Pathology","slug":"liverpool-medical-clinic-bur-dubai-gynaecology-paediatrics-general-medicine-dental-physiotherapy-pathology","address":"Burdubai - Khalid Bin Al Waleed Rd - Al Raffa - Dubai - United Arab Emirates","area":"Dubai","phone":"058 138 8060","website":"https://liverpoolclinics.com/","rating":4.9,"reviewCount":206,"services":["General Dentistry","Teeth Whitening","Root Canal"],"hours":"Mon-Sat: 8:00 AM – 10:00 PM","description":"Professional dental care in Dubai offering comprehensive dental services.","lat":25.259315899999997,"lng":55.2876882,"placeId":"ChIJKRyFYRRDXz4RLeo7OR2bjmo","googleMapsUrl":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=7678244964529859117&g_mp=Cidnb29nbGUubWFwcy5wbGFjZXMudjEuUGxhY2VzLlNlYXJjaFRleHQQAhgEIAA","reviews":[{"author":"Mohi Ghulam","rating":5,"text":"I had a really great experience with Dr. Rifaaz at Liverpool Clinic.

I wish I could share my child teeth it would be perfect for other people to see.\\n\\nLol it was not a complex case as they claimed on second visit, the child is only 14 years old and teeth are properly aligned already it just need dental cleaning and few more adjustment but they want to ripe us off.\\nSo my advice for the upcoming patient is to document everything and ask the fees in advance before any other procedure. They have their own individual pricing and they are not honest about it, so be mindful of that. I also ask for the number of the owner and email address but the receptionist failed to provide me because she knew that I will complain her\uD83D\uDE02\uD83E\uDD23.\\n\\nGod Bless and I hope you are happy wasting people precious time.","time":"2025-09-02T16:06:00.144516165Z"}],"types":["dentist","dental_clinic","doctor","medical_clinic","health","point_of_interest","establishment"],"photos":["places/ChIJT6Uhos9cXz4REzzfKF3hRWc/photos/AcnlKN1P_8toW6mIjPxkHSRompvZgSe5IDNfsoFtw9ZGeoFDK74WCBrDCrffRF3xfnwAxfkICsfiJqAPwAW4Q70zEdKWgSgp8_iAmHQQ5mO5CSPM42bs6Ub8ndJzDcVhc8RCtWv2AzZ-rpTbf32FfwG-d9ZeIpNi-wccZnBxfCXGSgEV5P8SEVGhrwUb6EAegqUEtLN-X08ZCjOojRep3keQBuI2gt-GmCiaGUa-nXPA3SE_Yp0rIzfHxZuhLs9_CFbFWe44nlQpFVUScY8kl2ewhHDNkUsu6PzePDKEBgtKVNgHIw","places/ChIJT6Uhos9cXz4REzzfKF3hRWc/photos/AcnlKN1L_ZSan36crTGvUsdlobFi7MIyRPSuwSrVJU3p3EK192GHcu7ewwxEYg6ih3jSQ8CfunyymJZdOwB888BWEFzxS9-b0CqEE-AWMBb8nNDm6X59QDFfeVaaGBa0VN6fxC4Xr_alCAA7TpupbyxyuiPJHMyPuRoL87CVP1wbzjL85Q1pToy-lcb2Xv0UiVWn1Og6_QB-737z4vI2gP9RQjRTtuQROcePL23Bm2IlVTJ75tk5VuXydVszfzdvvG1ZUet6VU7ueNx164kAZcCicmHcXtb67bRRAmRra8Sv7SczQkrrmQEnkn-G1KEKFXN-KJz33ECq1LwB9kEpQfgtBJ4QaD-i4Bm_FqAL87RVvdlI9ThZE2ezUf7ApIfp01SgRVLKimMFs6u00cpN3apaoUtaLRO25kbij6bs4eNoAnFtFQ","places/ChIJT6Uhos9cXz4REzzfKF3hRWc/photos/AcnlKN028saPbVD0Y2a_GyLC0iuqB8mAv_asLmS8tYE9b_ZVgsDSXDt9KyHg0-9xIDI549Z1gHemDmokn9J1C-qzNHAtpjIjH4W98HCv9Q8Wq1RkVDCP3wRYgmu9yi8vb8vbe8U8KYTwjQzi3x2bahWFu2qwj8fLFVwb_ScTL_PKjk3kjqxLut23RIKxJpN3Bud_0EpX6fXwX9P8JZOY_nigyEAYdzh4f3CeUDU_FamomCzX8n9eeQuF3h-PHy5XFNQPBwYORE_nGWdDx_i9NLRDXcLcI4l9GG0vzWDv_dtlQCOeiPW4pIhcsfebgcDotg8NYTCuIAOCz8t53lSJe7bGSLThPSv48g2isWKWz-yv2Jmt7mejXRxj_wkaBt3fv8IvUONn5kHe_lBWOuHooZi_lCEv-bWy4LziT_-SiONIif368A"]},{"name":"Oracare Dental Clinic","slug":"oracare-dental-clinic","address":"110, Eissa Lutfi Building/Zen Interior Bldg., Near Mashreq Metro Station، - شارع الشيخ زايد - البرشاء الأولى - البرشاء - دبي - United Arab Emirates","area":"Dubai","phone":"050 764 2285","website":"https://oracaredubai.com/","rating":4.9,"reviewCount":197,"services":["General Dentistry","Teeth Whitening","Root Canal"],"hours":"Mon-Sat: 11:00 AM – 7:00 PM","description":"Professional dental care in Dubai offering comprehensive dental services.","lat":25.1132247,"lng":55.189374,"placeId":"ChIJD0yVXKJrXz4RkPShGKiPIEM","googleMapsUrl":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=4837023951926457488&g_mp=Cidnb29nbGUubWFwcy5wbGFjZXMudjEuUGxhY2VzLlNlYXJjaFRleHQQAhgEIAA","reviews":[{"author":"hami a","rating":5,"text":"The best dental clinic I’ve been to in Dubai.

I never felt judged or talked down to, which is something I’ve experienced at other clinics before.\\nDuring the procedure, everything was explained step by step, and they made sure I was numb and comfortable the entire time. I was surprised by how gentle and efficient the dentist was—I barely felt anything. They also gave me helpful aftercare instructions and practical tips for maintaining better oral hygiene at home.\\nWhat stood out most to me was how genuinely they seemed to care about their patients, not just rushing people in and out. The clinic feels well-organized, professional, and focused on quality care rather than just getting through appointments.\\nI left feeling relieved, informed, and actually confident about coming back for future visits.

I was first told the treatment cost was AED 3,500. Later, I was charged AED 3,000 the receipt down here. However, in the reply to my review, it was stated that the original price was AED 5,000 reduced to AED 2,400. This wasn’t the case in my experience so if you’re not sure about something do not spit it I was never quoted AED 5,000 and no one will give you a discount of 54%.\\nAfter I posted my review, I also received several phone calls (by someone of the staff not Dr. Mohammed)asking me to delete it, which made me feel pressured.

Long story short: terrible teeth run in my family so I have spend lots of time with dentists.  The  specific reason I went to Acer was  a premolar which has been bothering me for over 10 years and was finally extracted. After the extraction I did not feel good with my previous dentist recommendation to do a bridge based on me being a smoker solely. I visited ACER - specifically Dr Jogi as I wanted to properly discuss implants with an expert. Obviously he begged me not to ruin the healthy neighbouring teeth with a bridge- we did specialised scan, got a quote and we discussed it all .Over the next month I went through all the studied re smokers, weak bone,  implants, healing time etc and then I had couple of hours what\'s app sessions with him re few of the contradicting studies. By the second what\'s app chat I was convinced I do not want the bridge and was open to doing an implant. We fitted the prostatic today and it is perfection - look, feel, exceeded my expectations. The process is long (3m) BUT its done properly , the pain is absolute minimum (I have bad gums which are extremely sensitive) and the result is worth it. I have a bridge on the other side of my jaw and cant wait to replace with another implant soon :) Dr Jogi and his whole team - the x-ray team, the nurses, the reception team and his fellow dentists are so kind , friendly and most importantly eager to discuss with you anything on your mind. Clinic is clean and has a happy, relaxed , calm feel to it. Pricing is great and frankly too low for their quality of work and compared to other clinics. I would  recommend them to anyone who needs a good team of dentists who  put your oral health before your bank account balance , and a place where any and all of your questions are welcome and answered. :)","time":"2025-11-22T15:33:47.300496940Z"},{"author":"Clare Willson","rating":5,"text":"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\\nI can’t thank Dr Jogi and his team enough for their exceptional care and professionalism!\\n\\nI’m an extremely nervous patient, but the reassurance, kindness, and genuine care I received were truly first-class.

I had personal conversations with Dr Rena on teeth hygiene, informing me on my teeth and how to take care of them and what to use and what techniques to use. I got my new toothbrush from the clinic after Dr Rena educated me on dental hygiene. Dr Stephanie completing my fillings treatment and she was great, kind and extremely welcoming.

The doctor said he was fine, but I clearly saw the same signs my child had during a previous severe reaction a year ago: a change in voice, vomiting, severe abdominal pain, difficulty breathing, drooling, and nasal discharge. I told the doctor that my child was having a severe allergic reaction and that we needed to administer the EpiPen. However, he insisted that it was not necessary and that nebulized adrenaline would be enough, telling me my child was fine, even though I knew these were clear symptoms of a severe reaction.\\n\\nWhen I insisted that my child needed the EpiPen (as per standard protocol for his condition), the doctor dismissed my concern and left the room. He put me in a position where I had to argue for the correct treatment. He questioned my judgment and made me doubt myself, asking me repeatedly what I wanted as if it was not an emergency, despite me clearly explaining that my child had a history of severe reactions and needed the EpiPen, which another clinic had correctly administered in a similar situation a year ago.\\n\\nIn the end, the doctor did not assist in administering the EpiPen. I had the EpiPen with me the entire time and was simply asking for it to be applied. He only told the nurses to do it, but they did not know how to handle it properly and clearly stated that they did not even know how to remove the EpiPen from its plastic container. As a result, the EpiPen was not administered at all. neither by the doctor nor by the nurses. I was desperately asking for help because I could not do it alone, and instead I found myself having to instruct them while my child was in distress. The entire situation was chaotic and dangerous, and I ultimately had to leave the clinic and seek help elsewhere because I felt that my child’s life was not being prioritized.\\n\\nI want this review to be a warning: this clinic did not follow basic emergency procedures for a severe allergic reaction and instead left me to figure it out myself. I cannot recommend them and urge others to be cautious.\\n\\nThis happened on December 10, 2025, around 6:00 to 7:00 PM.\\n\\nUltimately, I had to leave the clinic and seek help elsewhere, administering corticosteroids myself before rushing out. Thank God, giving him additional corticosteroids bought us some time to reach another hospital, where they handled the situation properly and my son spent the night admitted for observation. This delay and lack of proper care could have had severe consequences.","time":"2025-12-12T19:37:36.423751810Z"},{"author":"Kate Mogylevska","rating":1,"text":"I had an appointment today with gynecologist XXX ( I was called and asked to remove the name of the doctor because it’s illegal) — a very rude woman.

I had even adjusted my work hours to see the dentist. When I called, I was met with no sense of responsibility or apology.\\n•\\tLater, I booked again since their prices seemed affordable for a student. My 12:30 appointment was moved to 12:00, but treatment only started at 12:10.\\n•\\tThe X-ray staff was friendly, but the doctor seemed rushed, kept leaving the room, and the whole treatment felt unsatisfactory.\\n•\\tWhat shocked me most: I was given medicine without being informed, which doubled my bill from 300 kr to 600 kr. As a student, that’s a lot, and I should have been told before any extra costs were added.\\n\\nAfter leaving a review about this, I was contacted and asked to delete it. Later, they threatened me with a no-show invoice, even though it was they who rescheduled my appointment last minute. On 2 October, I even received a phone call threatening police action if I “did anything else.” Finally, I was sent an 850 kr invoice when the original appointment fee was only 300 kr.\\n\\nAll the prove are attached in the picture\\n\\nUpdate:\\nI got an reply to this review. Which is totally false\\nbecause he called me and said he is gonna send me invoice and in the reply it’s saying it’s automatically \uD83D\uDE02\\n\\nThe thing was my appointment was at 8.30 but I got an sms at 7:33 that my appointment is reschedule to 9:30 without contacting me. When I called them there no apology from their side and I was not free on 9:30.\\nThen everything was fine.\\n\\nAfter posting the review this Ahmed called me at 20:59. Totally insane.\\n\\nNext morning he called me and informed me he is going to send me invoice ( but for their fault) so its not automatically sended invoice. And from my side I already disputed by mail and sms and calling. Till now no solution.\\n\\n. I do not suggest this dental clinic who will call patient at 20:59 and intentionally send invoice just for an honest review  to harras patient.\\n\\nUpdate again ( 23 October) : Today I got call to delete the review.

There were only 6 people waiting but the Reception Staff (one was busy in setting Printer and he was busy on his Mobile and another was talking to somebody).

I went to Dr. Kamran and told him and he said I will talk to them. Then he talked to the Reception Staff through Intercom. I went to Receiption again and one of the staff has taken my Emirates ID again and kept below the other cards and asked me to wait. Then they called other person to register his case.

And coming to my point after 35 mins of time doctor went and when I asked about it they  just smiling , I was literally in shock there is a reason why people book appointment they don’t value people, we weren’t coming for movie or mall it’s a clinic we are coming there when we have problems literally they aren’t understanding it.

I wanted her to follow the same treatment plan as i had in the past because it worked,  she wanted to have her own plan not considering all aspects of my clinical situation. I was unhappy with that but then i have agreed on her plan just to have something done as when retainer is broken you risk of getting complications.\\n- After 20 minutes of discussion, in spite of me asking for help Dr. Moza refused to install new retainer even following her treatment plan\\n\\nResult after my interactions with Dentcare clinic:\\n- i have lost time\\n- i was given false promises of help\\n- i am left without orthodontic help with broken retainer hurting gums and making very hard to eat\\n- i have to urgently find a new orthodontist in a day which is not easy\\n\\nWhat i would do if i knew it all before - i would have waited a made an appointment to Medcare clinic.\\nAs a doctor and a busy person i never write reviews.\\nBut in this case i decided to invest my time in it and even attach photos of my broken retainer (to make sure the clinic will not call ma a liar) because i truly believe that all patients deserve proper medical care and need to know the truth before coming to clinic.","time":"2022-06-23T13:26:23.709226Z"},{"author":"Linda Franca","rating":1,"text":"I am writing to express my concerns regarding the quality of service at this facility. My boyfriend, Joris, visited this dentist over a month ago for treatment on a chipped tooth. Unfortunately, the outcome was unsatisfactory, as the tooth was visibly misaligned after the procedure. The dentist who performed the work advised him to return two days later to improve it.\\n\\nLess than 10 hours after the second procedure, the fixed part just dropped from his tooth. After waiting for a follow-up appointment, Joris just returned and the procedure was redone by a different dentist. However, upon returning home, it was clear that the new tooth was uneven, with one side significantly longer and thicker than the other. On top of this he told me that the service was unprofessional, especially compared to the first two visits.\\n\\nA month and a half later, the tooth just let loose again during the night (yesterday). This repeated issue raises concerns about either the proficiency of the dental staff or the possibility of inadequate practices. Despite multiple attempts (3 procedures) to rectify the problem, the tooth has not been properly fixed.\\n\\nI hope this feedback will be taken seriously and lead to improvements in the quality of care provided.","time":"2024-09-16T05:00:12.426652Z"}],"types":["dental_clinic","medical_clinic","health","point_of_interest","establishment"],"photos":["places/ChIJP0Azb3RrXz4Rq-ldAfC1HCI/photos/AcnlKN2m7ckfzmmTzoLks3epA6mxDbs3h1Rzbajd1Es32Zm29sOHjsoVB9JfNg9232oszVLn1fTyR8aU_YeqN0q9R49LV6qlZje7po1PCY9ABdQgNg_PRvvp-wwReqTsZwsv0MibNxdyRywaM8OaaMEFDtvgKcagcQ-pClgnsfup8uiY4EAqUr2xfYe7h2rb_kQuevtvK8hw6bytGQmp2xsc412UrnbEBNbsLKKx_3bqCGphq1TCGxKDyvMa1YIFjg8u5fr06WH0u_29O4qp6cUdE9O7yO8ddiTq98VNrun3mngQmg","places/ChIJP0Azb3RrXz4Rq-ldAfC1HCI/photos/AcnlKN2Lia8tLJDdD8Jx2-5Kf4Wq5OX91uyJcVkS1FEXchg7PSOVmrUCg2BFNzwCVRuVqG84isDZO-7C3MsITJXg6NkiweYbyk0ZHn73_4JViyBG-0eD3GoARHQA311VWk8AX-HbDLQ9DkZ_yg8g2EMAiiIQT70XM3a7nV8oV6YK0MFYpAH9W0xsnxHtJxjiTNHBtrBgW_vvN1kUYZf-V3uQTI2tszmnOo5wkTcND5ZbUaI-GO_oivvPnNjPRanL-jxdAX0CTeXdrn1Ut2n1co_HkdNGG2fodo_HBi2X6cbznCZXwA","places/ChIJP0Azb3RrXz4Rq-ldAfC1HCI/photos/AcnlKN101VBiAiN6rMMnoNf31hGRnttKxj27WRQLyaVZQhGjhh01G1No31SnWlW-aSw9bxkODmkpQ06-LxJ_5QffM1DhFeLGq6wobSAzNMVFr7acu33dUfeXmb73bhewOvOQblWsVjs5gdoY8aSGcrmEJIGGpE-vm8YaUhpQUuop7FZFl63Yn7YmWtXfs-Yw3D5MiP_zXQktPTGrVR5tVox25LMmZo6EH66RXAOrUyJi0eJVcgALJ02n3ViWikRAOxBBpUnsKgT7L0e_gXbJhoucGlNilxQk4TIcU1HypRcg1jYLag"]},{"name":"Right Health Al Azhar Clinic (DIP Branch)","slug":"right-health-al-azhar-clinic-dip-branch","address":"Shop no. 5, Ali Mesmar shopping mall DIP labor accommodation area - مجمع دبي للاستثمار الأول - دبي - United Arab Emirates","area":"Dubai","phone":"800 7400","website":"https://righthealth.ae/","rating":4.7,"reviewCount":56,"services":["General Dentistry","Teeth Whitening","Root Canal"],"hours":"Mon-Sat: 9:00 AM – 9:30 PM","description":"Professional dental care in Dubai offering comprehensive dental services.","lat":24.971828100000003,"lng":55.1706588,"placeId":"ChIJEfFiU-VyXz4RTfBAlcl9-0s","googleMapsUrl":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=5475108076744929357&g_mp=Cidnb29nbGUubWFwcy5wbGFjZXMudjEuUGxhY2VzLlNlYXJjaFRleHQQAhgEIAA","reviews":[{"author":"Sachintha Siriwardena","rating":5,"text":"I had a severe pain in my upper right side wisdom tooth and came to meet Dr.Vimla and she was very pleasant and professional and done the extraction without any pain at all.

To the grace of god, I found one clinic which was open in Karama and the name was MIH Dental Clinic. It was one of my best decisions to choose this clinic for my treatment. From the first call onwards all the staff were too friendly and caring. They tried to comfort me while I was in pain. Then I consulted Dr Yasir in this clinic. He was so good at what he does. My teeth has to be removed through a surgical process and it was a time consuming task. However, he showed ultimate patience while extracting my tooth. He gave much care to reduce my suffering. He was never in a hurry, took time and extracted the tooth successfully. I will give him 10/10 rating. And after all this best services, he gave me a discount too.

I visit this dental clinic on 22/Dec, Dr Shima Joorabxhi did the dental cleaning for me. I felt not comfortable for the cleaning time, and vomiting twice, because I felt too much pain and her medical mirror go through my tone and throat.  After that it’s bleeding, and the staff told me they open all the gum and clean.\\n\\n2. Until the second day, it’s still bleeding scary, please look at the attached photo. I went back to the clinic, and she did clean and treatment for me, saying after 15-20mins it could be stop bleeding, but useless.  Which make me more angry Is that Dr. Shima did not feel sorry, and claiming that is not her fault at all. And she provided me medicine without asking me about allergy questions. I took the Amoxicillin and the other one immediately, cuz I want to stop bleeding soon, and I take doctor provided medicine without checking the medicine, and the amoxicillin is without instructions. After 2 hours, I felt itchy, I noticed that it’s allergy, then I ask them what medicine they provide me. I have heavy allergy to penicillin, Amoxicillin is one of them.\\nI went to hospital immediately at the same day, it’s nearly killed me. They took me as emergency case, because I got fever, full body itching and burning, shaking, and fall in a faint.  For all information: Medicine allergy could lead to shock and death.\\nOverall, this is my experience for these days, till now I’m still suffering from inside skin itching, burning and swelling.

My wife, at times, was visiting Dr. Subair and she had insisted to discuss this issue with Dr. Subair before taking a final call for surgery. So, I visited Dr. Subair and he suggested that there is an option of very good treatment for this condition in Homeopathy and it may take around 3 months for considerable improvement from the current position.

I told the receptionist that I was very tired, so a staff member there told me again to wait. He said it wasn\'t time. I waited for two hours and then told me to wait again. Finally, I asked for my ID back. The receptionist still said to wait. So what I\'m asking is, who should I ask when a patient comes to the reception? Finally, when the doctor wrote the prescription and left, it was 7:40. Please understand the patients who come in very tired, take care of them as soon as possible and send them back very quickly.

I personally met Mr. Ayham for the case and had high expectations.\\n\\nHowever, I am deeply disappointed with my experience at this lab. As a fellow dentist, I expected professionalism and meticulous attention to detail, but the service I received was far below standard. The mockup for my full-mouth veneers case failed multiple times, yet the team proceeded to PMMA temporaries without resolving the initial issues.\\n\\nThroughout the process, a WhatsApp group was created to discuss the problems, but my calls and messages were largely ignored. Mr. Ayham was active on social media but did not address any concerns regarding the case.\\n\\nAfter all these issues, I received a lengthy invoice for work that was incomplete and unsatisfactory. This experience caused unnecessary stress for both me and my patient. Based on this, I do not consider the work payable, and I am very disappointed that my concerns were never properly addressed.\\n\\nWhen the PMMA temporaries were also done poorly, I decided to stop proceeding with the lab and switched to another lab to continue the case. I had to repeat the entire process from scratch — starting again with the mockup and PMMA, which caused further delays and frustration.\\n\\nI share this review to provide an honest account for my colleagues and patients. Professionalism, accountability, and clear communication are essential pillars in dentistry. Unfortunately, throughout this entire process, I experienced a consistent lack of accountability with calls unanswered, messages ignored, and concerns dismissed. This disregard not only compromised the quality of care I strive to deliver but also caused significant frustration and delay. Regrettably, my experience with this lab fell far short of the professional standards I expect and uphold in my own practice","time":"2025-11-15T11:17:56.838921268Z"},{"author":"Beeta Nikoopour","rating":5,"text":"Sometimes you have to leave the continent in search of perfection.

Being a mother herself she understood our fears and helped alleviate it without stressing us further.","time":"2024-01-25T08:36:17.494033Z"}],"types":["dentist","doctor","health","point_of_interest","establishment"],"photos":["places/ChIJFZlYgT1DXz4RBxPkW3Uhi3c/photos/AcnlKN1qbU0RxBeRuRur2ekzQm7fQDjjEC6uDtyD3pcjJ3JgZLdwu-DDnd1p6SRxjeojYJoM-1lR-7V95d6hInTrvZUdH9et6Mj6ognmXVjlBx7et2ue4RHFdU11J2bWsu4Sdf7o61mtRYp2ree06qixggRWnUtdtNb1qttf-VPrHUpgDj1pzXSyXWqfLGwXPGLdL5jARZHW_t-q8MptrxQlH7aoaPdUPSLwP4A0Y8qK_I-038BnFIzPnBma5-pkGoiU11tPP4nSZvMeD__qnUUKWGz8imekOO8q1Qg48lxBjBopkw","places/ChIJFZlYgT1DXz4RBxPkW3Uhi3c/photos/AcnlKN3sku9RzZy-Hg6wHjGMv8n5DFXpuwFsMFIa1kEqLpKGa-IpgoalckSmLC06hoTXcsSqmWVdQWdik9wsFdcRhZCk8EaGvLZFPiMwsmnEh3zUyDhl7Koe1wvcaOxSWuMtTkJuxGqxX92t1Zr-sGvVlsxEcyq-mcoKavfHUmh2J0iAPO2mAv4PMUS-adveGoWuX-4di3rw60QfvzhY0MZF8Y__P0MlySSL2DuZ8NiPsZhjslS7aS46kaaKb4hmARhflKXmkZXxB3x6c2WZwmSgL_T6CASMVut8zHNG7cu8sViKvw","places/ChIJFZlYgT1DXz4RBxPkW3Uhi3c/photos/AcnlKN1rCbExwE4wC5IJVONgX_u9W4qB5Ywr2npZlGk7ckCWWxMw3KDPjZTT5mw6N7YMGVUbJbiZAjVhZIA5GihJ5cCLkwO4sDknxIKAOq5vmyd6FDlgwGpACOfCyIkjHTwoWYiWkuuz3N8sA3A3YFIMVgti8dvyU6qK1v66XBeaxU5RCpfWXtvofRpvoxfvXYiYYEveupMF13VgO06jeP3Zb2M-74VL01-Duu4niN9I3hLQ13fyK1cVPPznaPTtOBOY7VEtBDRe8z_alME0yyupRYshktNVoTFyzJP9OWWBcj5yTw"]},{"name":"Dr Manoj Kumar - Dentist in Al Barsha","slug":"dr-manoj-kumar-dentist-in-al-barsha","address":"Dussledorf Business Point 305 - 1 Al Barsha Rd - Al Barsha First - Al Barsha - Dubai - United Arab Emirates","area":"Al Barsha","phone":"050 756 0728","website":"http://www.esthetixdentalcenters.com/","rating":5,"reviewCount":20,"services":["General Dentistry","Teeth Whitening","Root Canal"],"hours":"Mon-Sat: 9:00 AM – 10:00 PM","description":"Professional dental care in Al Barsha offering comprehensive dental services.","lat":25.11458,"lng":55.2048292,"placeId":"ChIJ30dgezBrXz4RkKtzKczqGT4","googleMapsUrl":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=4474865867358972816&g_mp=Cidnb29nbGUubWFwcy5wbGFjZXMudjEuUGxhY2VzLlNlYXJjaFRleHQQAhgEIAA","reviews":[{"author":"raja lingam","rating":5,"text":"I recently visited Dr.manoj kumar regarding dental cleaning and polishing i was fully satisfied with his work.

I had 2 root canals, 5 fillings and general cleaning done at the dental clinic in MedStar and it was one of the best procedures I\'ve undergone.\\nI have never gone through a root canal before and like many first timers out there, i heard rumours that it was one of the most painful and scary procedures to go through. Well, that was a very different description to what I actually experienced with Doctor Indraniil Roy and Doctor John Charlie Maveli. From the start they made me feel calm and even played my favorite music in the room - both before and during the procedure - that was a very useful distraction! Both Doctors consistently asked whether I was in any discomfort or experienced any pain (it shows you that they care, they\'re not just trying to get the job done as quick as possible). They constantly explained what was happening at every stage of the procedure so that I wasn\'t anxious or would be taken by surprise. Overall, I had almost no pain post surgery and the entire journey was worth it! The Doctors also regularly checked up days after the procedure to ensure things went smoothly. I highly recommend these 2 Doctors!\\nA very special thanks to Dr. Jyothi S Charlie who was very professional throughout all my visits and always comforted me when I was scared or felt nervous. She assured me that my treatments would go smoothly and she was right. She finished the capping of my root canal which looks amazing and fits very nicely - she also did 5 fillings and now my teeth look and feel great. Definitely coming back to her!

I estimate that the cost of my treatment so far is 50% cheaper than the other clinics.\\nVery highly recommended by both myself and my wife who is also now a client of Charltpolyclinic and Dr. Jyothi","time":"2013-05-31T05:39:40.171393Z"}],"types":["dentist","dental_clinic","medical_center","medical_clinic","hospital","point_of_interest","health","service","establishment"],"photos":["places/ChIJ_Zm0wd5CXz4RqFw-Tj04c5I/photos/AcnlKN04UQaOZ4m06xWE14_c7zPq2WPJiRzBDlv2VtbdlqZM2ClxR4B0CFv0XUpooxmCUxsd77HbLvJ2HD98VGib6CAnF9Y4RY9x_2wdgs8X7yXwvgS0Du8_YCbDSjqXChz6lbatxYU-mzCSJQtNxQicL0AhV7y7EU2iCQeD_Ehf6A_8h_A5xgpt-8AWXjtOvLoRMygmhSTrATjsnNcaipY7WxG2X1O41bhm_I6ig2hAI0RrfxE4MbzX6S3gq8bt1-MuLjwzC4AsDhDSbgoTfufA7lrnwetJ3joQyRd72KhEV6w-lgaAatv8TNR1mUFi0WLnXsVJTtoO98nAk47y60pt-_KPPudfcFxuzSD1HL7i9E0tOD0U2TbZdKjJveU3pZLAuf3R8EzmZu937eAIofe93zY7dGWnGD6mPk-RC9GwOHCkQQ","places/ChIJ_Zm0wd5CXz4RqFw-Tj04c5I/photos/AcnlKN3i0eMVrrxiOV_wDKg35QCW5xvhsZCKNEYDdE7q6-DRLUhpfx22MHFmQcVx-Uo-toWRRBAeSFxsc1orxnIqHd5x0oOaMyDfg68R_d2Cc2VjPJlyKSf0gJHgBG8ycDE9ieRZiI4Vy2VV2NkIpLWj9DOCdUf2EjGsy_McDlC8T2TQb96FBfMYM07aJvFten_kAp6VpWDI-MysvIt9Xo6uvLk7zYlURnPrquToyFYlkJPFBdJFzIaSkU7kbEJqFUzsR2oACNcjvWhSAMG8zz9UWqVoO9cLaIPtf_Bj78yFYtB7gImXNaJPJEIxJdhSS53w4UQ7o_9rt8XIDUSuioGyAPlwoTpXntYWmOAK-FTqY2uIwdBjFbneqRyZLK10MRPDicnAPzwPfO6hfjhwbLTExDsohhW34NsdRhmvlBcTCU8dHA","places/ChIJ_Zm0wd5CXz4RqFw-Tj04c5I/photos/AcnlKN0LX1KLT_oYUVYFitGlFAp9EqW8B9sEp6z7BIxfgoTmZih7Me-So3L4mrFHkl3wi9N_xz8aExGFxsuNoHLLvEtsmEA7lxzqOWc24dAZ2YpgnJxIHAoghfGCiwTeL1LdyVhhbUNTAcM4RRK5CyUgJXIPtSDrwhtDo2qG_r-qvXzPfAh6wkAyF66xTz0kgviLqAG2I4_U56dT1Nvo7rw9DIqRjA8tMqP118jFGkVkalQGIKmJ-KA_3aGclIA83XUUETVRWyhKUzFsg6QPyi754yAbH95hd3fKedBvtxdlfEWeiw"]},{"name":"Empire Dental Clinic Dubai","slug":"empire-dental-clinic-dubai","address":"Marasi Dr - Business Bay - Dubai - United Arab Emirates","area":"Business Bay","phone":"04 276 6577","website":"http://www.empiredentalclinic.ae/","rating":4.6,"reviewCount":19,"services":["General Dentistry","Teeth Whitening","Root Canal"],"hours":"Mon-Sat: 10:00 AM – 7:00 PM","description":"Professional dental care in Business Bay offering comprehensive dental services.","lat":25.192145999999997,"lng":55.285149999999994,"placeId":"ChIJe_BFwSVoXz4RaqRDjdjjh7I","googleMapsUrl":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=12864501379829572714&g_mp=Cidnb29nbGUubWFwcy5wbGFjZXMudjEuUGxhY2VzLlNlYXJjaFRleHQQAhgEIAA","reviews":[{"author":"John Murray","rating":5,"text":"Throughly recommend Empire and Dr. Ammar Kayali who is a true gent, staff are excellent also.

Patient-centred care is clearly perceived to be important to optimise the satisfaction and well-being of patients. The purpose of this paper is to review current patient-centred practices for outpatients in both private clinics and public hospitals in Dubai. Such a comparison contributes to the identification of best management practices as a means of enhancing healthcare delivery.\\n\\nDesign/methodology/approach:\xa0This study is based on an independent survey consisting of self-administered questionnaires, in which patients were asked to rate several aspects of private clinics or government hospitals in Dubai. The questionnaire used has been drawn from the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Clinician and Group Survey, Version 3.0. Responses from 420 patients form a data set that is analysed quantitatively.\\n\\nFindings:\xa0In total, 420 respondents took part in this survey. The results of the survey show that there is a considerable difference between the expectation levels of patients from government hospitals and patients from private clinics. Patients from government hospitals consistently show that time is a critical aspect of the service received, with 68 per cent of the respondents reporting this issue. Additionally, poor customer care, as reported by 14 per cent of the respondents, is also a critical issue. Timely service and appointments are among the main factors that contribute to patient satisfaction. Patients in private clinics, instead, particularly value clear explanations from doctors and nurses - this is corroborated by the fact that 11 per cent of the respondents reported appreciation of this type of service.\\n\\nPractical implications:\xa0This paper draws attention to a patient-centric perspective of healthcare, and highlights the importance of educating patients through clear explanations.\\n\\nOriginality/value:\xa0Little evidence exists on the standards of healthcare in Dubai. The authors explore this area and present direct evidence on quality standard implementation, identify implementation shortcomings and make recommendations for future research and practice.\\n\\nKeywords:\xa0Patient centredness; Patient satisfaction; Private healthcare; Public health service; Quality assessment.","time":"2023-06-10T16:22:08.218071Z"},{"author":"Atif Zareen","rating":5,"text":"I visited few days ago, staff was super helpful from front desk to GP Doctor good experience overall thanks right health team Sonapur","time":"2025-11-24T03:58:07.849905331Z"},{"author":"Salman Ahmed","rating":5,"text":"I had the pleasure of seeing Dr.Abdul Razzaque and I must say that my experience was nothing short of exceptional.

From the moment we walk in, her warmth and friendliness make my children feel completely at ease. It’s amazing to see how they don’t dread going to the dentist—coming home from an appointment feels more like a friendly visit to see someone they genuinely enjoy, who just happens to be checking their teeth.\\n\\nWhat I appreciate most is her unwavering patience and thoroughness. She answers every single question we have, no matter how small, absurd or repetitive, with such depth and clarity. It’s clear that she genuinely cares about both the well-being of my children and the peace of mind of us as parents. I never feel rushed or brushed aside; she takes the time to ensure that we fully understand everything. We trust her completely with our kids’ dental health, and that level of trust means everything.\\n\\nBeyond just dental care, she truly sees my kids as little people and always goes out of her way to make sure they’re comfortable and happy during each visit. She even makes it a point to ensure they get to their after-school activities on time, as promised, which we really appreciate as busy parents.\\n\\nHer commitment to her patients is unmatched, and we always leave feeling confident and reassured. If you’re looking for a pediatric dentist who combines professionalism with warmth and makes each visit an enjoyable experience, look no further. We are incredibly grateful for her and the positive impact she’s had on our kids’ dental health and overall experience!","time":"2025-03-12T10:12:37.329172Z"},{"author":"cecile freiha","rating":5,"text":"The most amazing pediatric dentist I have known!

I got a crown done on my upper teeth at their dental clinic at Sports City. The crown affected my bite so I went back a day later and told the dentist that the crown she fitted on my upper teeth prevented my upper and lower teeth from coming into contact as the crown was taller than my other upper teeth. She responded rudely to me saying why I didn\'t tell her that when she was performing the crowning procedure. As a dentist, it was her responsibility to check and ask me whether the crown was affecting my bite while performing the crowning procedure, but she didn\'t. Now after my complaint, instead of redoing the crown on my upper teeth, this dentist insisted on trimming down my lower tooth that was directly below the crowned tooth. I refused to let her trim my lower tooth as it was totally healthy and trimming it would cause it to be sensitive. Plus, the problem was not on my lower tooth, it was the upper teeth that needed the crown; so the only reason I see why she wanted to trim my lower tooth was because she wanted to avoid redoing the crown as it would be costly for her. She got furious and scolded at me. Finally I decided not to use this dentist to do my crown anymore and settled on just getting the crown she fitted on my upper teeth removed.","time":"2020-01-02T09:40:43.334456Z"},{"author":"Kritisha Kant","rating":1,"text":"Don’t even deserve 1 star rating.

From my first consultation, I knew I was in a place where they truly understood my concerns. The team was not only empathetic but also highly knowledgeable about the latest advancements in cosmetic dentistry.\\n\\nThey recommended Emax veneers for my front teeth – a solution that had never been offered to me before. Skeptical but desperate for a change, I decided to go ahead with it. And it was, without a doubt, one of the best decisions I\'ve ever made.\\n\\nThe process was smooth, and the care I received was exceptional. But nothing prepared me for the moment I saw my new smile. The veneers were incredibly natural-looking, perfectly matching the rest of my teeth. The discolouration was completely camouflaged, and for the first time in years, I felt confident smiling and laughing without restraint.\\n\\nThe impact of this transformation on my self-esteem has been profound. I no longer shy away from cameras or avoid social situations. My only regret is not coming to TheDentist.ae sooner.

The ambiance was welcoming and calming, something I hadn\'t experienced in a dental clinic before.\\n\\nMy main concern was a damaged tooth that needed a crown, and I also wanted to brighten my smile. The consultation with the dental team was incredibly thorough. They explained the process of getting a crown fitted and the teeth whitening procedure in detail, which put all my anxieties to rest.\\n\\nThe attention to detail during the crown fitting was impressive. The dentist took the time to ensure that the shape, size, and colour of the crown matched my natural teeth perfectly. It was a seamless process, and the result was a crown that felt and looked natural.\\n\\nThen came the teeth whitening – and it was transformative. The procedure was comfortable, and the staff ensured I was at ease throughout. The result was beyond my expectations; my teeth were several shades whiter, giving me a brighter and more confident smile.\\n\\nBut what truly sets TheDentist.ae apart is their aftercare. The follow-up appointments and the personalized care tips were immensely helpful. I felt supported not just during the procedures but also in the weeks that followed.\\n\\nNow, when I look in the mirror, I see a smile that reflects my newfound confidence. It\'s not just about aesthetics; it\'s about how I feel. I am so grateful to TheDentist.ae for their exceptional skill, care, and the way they transformed my smile.
